1,1," interesting movie about an interracial couple who decide to go for the weekend to visit the girls parents the boyfriend chris starts noticing odd behaviors from the african americans house workers and what started as a fun relaxing weekend slowly turns into a living nightmare for him

the idea is original and interesting the acting was good by all but i felt that daniel kaluuya was not emotional enough and his reactions was too cold in many scenes but generally speaking the movie is well paced from all aspects yet i wont call this a horror in anyway to me its no more than a psychological suspense thrillerit gets tense but never scary

the movie has its share of racism that cant go unnoticed but its not too much mainly stereotypical yet i believe that the concept of the plot can executed on any race which clearly hinted in stephen roots final scene an open minded audience can go throw it enjoy it without any care for its racism

2,2," i decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man

well i can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man and really the worst nightmare for us all this is not a film that tries to make the viewer feel sorry for black people nor is it at all preachy but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting im an old white guy by the way

the acting is wonderful and directing is amazing the film while mostly horror is actually completely hilarious in some parts making it the funniest and scariest movie i have seen in ages no easy feat it is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of academy award potential nominees because the directing and acting is honestly oscar worthy again no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny

in summary this is a must see at the theater and one of the best films of the year it is a fun ride that is very well done",positive,5
4,4," lets clear the air about this film its not a horror film its not a comedy what it is is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level worthy to be compared to hitchcock caliber the humor is there along with a few horror scenes but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story the film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires as far as complaints that the film is racist it is not it would work just as well with an allblack or allwhite cast those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film i most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves

8,8, i was totally blown away by get out this is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera i have ever seen jordan peele probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film however this shouldnt conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail it knows what it wants to say and how to say it balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clich√©s with stylistic bravura of course everything stems from a rock solid script where the plot points are cunningly engineered and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way there is much to admire and enjoy here including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing always serving a purpose within the narrative there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before kubrick and wes craven specially the plot involves one of those frequently visited fish out of the water type of settings where its up to the director to make the most out of it which fortunately is the case here since you get plenty of real character development and a tight innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin all this together with the inspired camera work contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in and make no mistake this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches if you thought that peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for get out will shock you silly and will make you think then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick,negative,1
10,10, short review if the races were switched as to whom was the predator and whom was the prey there would be national outrage and this would be a boycotted and hidden film there are limits in my personal opinion when you become too psychological too propagandizing in narratives that are inappropriate for society with an age that is strongly pushing an anticop racist and whiteprivilege tone i could not get past the obvious intentions to shape or at least strongly influence public thought towards problems that backroom backers seem to spare no opportunity to not be involved in to achieve societal perceptions i get tired of the double standards that exist where for some it is ok to unfairly demonize a race depending on which race it is i largely reject the anticipated arguments of lavish praise for efforts based on history that simply is not the present or simple artistic expression when america is a place where all methods of artistic expression or religious expression for that matter are equally protected and not shut up based on threat of violence advertiser boycotts or hate speech perhaps i might change my views this movie to me was as clear of an attempt to hide antiwhite propaganda under a guise and found the film to be disgusting and racist racism towards white people is not reverse racism the term alone being another evidence of how skewed society has become or somehow different than any racism towards any race this is racist plenty of films have been banned boycotted and protested for doing much less than the rampant antiwhite themes throughout this film and yet due to prevailing voices racism is indeed alive and well as the film broadly wishes to convince viewers of only not in the way intended by the production team,negative,1
11,11," in this era of disposable entertainment where we have no cultural memory and i fear no cultural future and people are living only for the next best thing is there no one who recognizes that this movie is almost a headon remake of ira levins the stepford wives  substitute racism for sexism and mix liberally no credit given to the original author the fact that not even the academy could recognize the wholly derivative plot shows how far we have fallen as a moviegoing public in all likelihood even jordan peale probably believes he wrote an original script he didnt and thats whats terrifying about get out

12,12," a rip off of the skeleton key the fact that peele stood there at the academy awards all emotional in his speech acting like he wrote the script is ridiculous universal made both pictures thats why theres no plagiarism law suit its a good story tsk is a much better movie though and with the gender and ethnicity of the main characters switched white girl vs black family doing vodoo in the skeleton key and after oscars so white it hit the zeitgeist thats fine but best original screenplay for peele what a joke

14,14," this movie is absolute garbage the only acting worth mentioning is the main characters and the overall plot seems to be written by an angry black teenager the racism theme you find here isnt anything related to the real world like  years a slave or django unchained i have no idea what granted peele an oscar for this film ive seen b movies much better than this and seeing someone go from comedy to director youd be  times better off watching a quiet place directed by john krasinski this movie left me feeling annoyed in the fact that ive wasted money and time on it even the emoji movie is more entertaining than get out save yourself and read a synopsis and skip the actual watching part  if i could give it

17,17," horror tension mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nailbiter in get out the astonishing directorial debut of jordan peele the former half of the comedy duo key  peele has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way thats unmistakably modern

in the tradition of the stepford wives with the twist of guess whos coming to dinner the story follows a young black man named chris daniel kaluuya who goes to meet his girlfriend roses allison williams parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop

with a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peacefulseeming suburb the tone is set immediately that theres cause for concern luckily for chris rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice and even when her parents bradley whitford and catherine keener or brother caleb landry jones seem to make chris blackness into a thing the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could the warning signs come in the form of the armitage familys black help maid georgina betty gabriel and groundskeeper walter marcus henderson whose behavior is anything but normal

peele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer michael abels also making his feature film debut the unpredictable nature of georgina and walter as characters the everincreasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does

kaluuya in a role that will deservedly put him on the map gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things and those who truly understand chris experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events it would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for chris

when a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as whitford keener and williams you know the script is good peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists the awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of peeles writing then of course theres the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film if that werent enough chris best friend lilrel howry provides comic relief in a way thats stereotypical yet peele uses him in unexpected ways so we get to benefit from peeles nose for comedy as well

not everything adds up by the end of get out but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion fans of horror and fans of thrillers who dont mind horror when its done well should both enjoy the technique and experience it provides thrills of the pulsepounding thrillseeking and thoughtprovoking variety and few genre films can say the same

thanks for reading visit movie muse reviews for more",negative,1
19,19," first of all in order for you to enjoy a horror movie you need to relate with the protagonist the main character in this movie keeps on the same dull and lifeless expression throughout most of the movie like he is constantly lost in his own thoughts even when someone comes out of the woods running at him full speed he remains there frozen staring into the void the plot twist is easy to anticipate early on this makes the second half of the movie boring and tedious actually you know who the bad guys are half hour in the movie its really easy since there are no good guys apparently finally this movie took the concept of skeleton key and replaced magic with science and blacks with whites

and if you ask why this movie has high ratings is because of modern politics every single white person is portrayed as evil and envious of black people in every aspect skin colour muscles talent even eyes thus critics gave it high ratings

20,20," ill say right off the bat i didnt really know who jordan peele was coming into this movie i knew he had a show with keeganmichael key and was a comedian of sorts what i didnt know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out

get out surprised me for a number of reasons the first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on there was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise and it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully you know something is wrong you know something is up but you cant quite figure out what it is

and secondly this was the work of a first time director its rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park

and lastly it gave us something new this is possibly the best aspect because i am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies people nowadays have forgotten that horror doesnt just mean blood and guts before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly its refreshing to see this done with such care

is it a perfect movie no it isnt but its damn good especially if youre in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones",positive,8
21,21," fantastic i would not call it horror but certainly thriller with some comedy thrown into it this jordan peele fellow has managed to bring something new to this genre and i certainly hope hell do more thrillers

the cast is great and i especially enjoyed betty gabriels performance lots of faces i have never seen before and they all did a stellar job and those faces i have seen before did a stellar job too 

i do not know if the overall idea is new but the way it was presented and the way it was done feels very fresh

warmly recommended

22,22," get out is no doubt a fine horror film but it aint anything special a young black man visit along with his white girlfriend her parents its pretty obvious shortly that this is a very politicial horror film based on very stupid liberal agenda and the only reason this movie was made was to please the new pc generation like i said its a ok horror film nothing more

24,24," get out is a disappointing and highly overrated movie that fails to meet even the most basic expectations of a horrorthriller it lacks any real scares is generally ineffective in its attempts to be creepy and many of the wouldbe thrills fall flat due to the fact that the plot is for the most part completely predictable with many of the plot twists glaringly obvious

to most viewers it will be fairly obvious what is going to happen in this movie from very early on and so the big twists really dont have any impact at all i was sat there waiting for something that i hadnt seen coming  a smart and welldisguised twist that all decent thrillers have but it never arrived

even to the very last scene get out is so predictable and never even attempts to think out of the box resulting in a rather dull boring and forgettable thriller

27,27," there is no way this movie could have a rating over  there is absolutely nothing new in this movie no new concept a fest of cliches even the twist was almost a copy of another movie skeleton key which i did not enjoy even and if a movie calls its own genre thriller or horror then the movie should keep some level of atmosphere to make the audience tense up to some point not saying that the atmosphere was even there it was made even worse by inserting some random jokes in between the movies which of course wasnt even humorous and the character development was the worst thing in this movie as some character shows passionate caring attitude and all of the sudden heshe turns into a complete psychopath it was so abrupt that heshe would even change the way heshe speaks to a person thats not even supposed to know something happened one of the key evidence that this movie was made without brains

lets just be honest the movie makers only cared about making profit mixing horror comedy and not forgetting to insert whiteisevil richisevil theme inside with a black person as main so that you can call all negative reviewers racist and sorry im not even white then using some way to make people spam positive reviews most of them which i highly doubt even saw the movie i honestly think more effort money was spent on making positive reviews rather than the movie itself hence the low budget movie",negative,1
31,31," this movie is appropriately in a genre mr jordan peele has christened social thriller the movie creates a very unsettling feeling from the beginning that slowly builds to a crescendo that forces the viewer to see prejudices head on when all is said and done you now have kind of a birds eye view of what is wrong with society but besides that it hints a hitchcocktype of thrill that is sure to deliver goosebumps a huge congratulations to jordan peele for hitting a home run his first time up to bat looking forward to future projects from him go see get out üòÄüòÄ

33,33," i cant believe the high score on this film im a massive film fan and this is one of my favorite genres so trust me when i say this is very very overrated the humor falls short and it is not scary in the slightest lets be honest this is the same propaganda that is in the news right now with the black lives matter and trump rubbish this is highly irresponsible and offensive to any white person and if the film was the other way around with whites and blacks then there would be a massive backlash how many films now play the race or sexism card now this film is a blatant rip off of skeleton key but skeleton key is actually a good film so ignore all the reviews on this film cause i cant help but think it just mirrors the sad state of the victim mentality and racism that is all the rage right now avoid

34,34," this movie received incredible reviews at the time of release and so i watched it with great anticipation however i was hugely disappointed it is nothing more than a run of the mill horror with a nasty thinly veiled message beneath it that all white people are racists whilst the premise is interesting it is played like its either a pastiche or an am dram production with a hint of hammer horror the plot has no surprises and by half way through it has become boring

40,40, the newest film made by jordan peele lives out to the hype that it madehorror comedy is one of the hardest genresor sub genres to make a movie aboutsome good examples would be evil dead  and screamthe film actually takes a subject like racism and makes it into a parody of itselfthe comedy of the movie is actually really subtle and youre not gonna walk into the movie and start laughing as a joke comes alongits a realization that can be made while watching the film or after you watched itit cant be really called a satire of horror movies because it uses the horror movie clich√©s more than once but the good part is that i doesnt annoy you like a lot of horror movies doone of the strengths of the movie is that you dont need to be an american to understand the storya basic knowledge about racism will be enoughbut for the clues and metaphors that are in the movie you need to pay more attention and know a little bit morethere are no jokes in the movie and even the comedy relief character lil rel howery doesnt make jokes but sells its comedy by his performance which makes him actually funny and not just an annoying side character like we see mostly in the movies right nowthe performances are great and the character choices are rational and logical unlike most horror movies we see todayallison williams does a pretty good job and actually nails the character far more better than i expectedthe cinematography is pretty good but it got distracting in two or three places of the movie but it wasnt boring and actually kept the movie pretty good lookingthe twists of the movie will actually kinda predictable but that wasnt what the movie was about and i didnt expected to be shocked since the movie doesnt take itself to seriously but serious enough to keep the plot goingthe cgi blood were kinda distracting and the movie got slow in a few places but it had the payoff and you were rewarded after the scenesthe movie is well made and deserves a second viewing in some time and i would recommend it to horror fans or if youre a fan of subtle humor and comedy,negative,3
41,41," the trailers and commercials looked awful but the reviews were great so i went to see the movie i was expecting something like an intellectual version of scary movie nope it was incredibly boring maybe the worst movie ive seen in five years i kept waiting for something to happen but nothing ever did i kept wondering how the hell did this movie get such good reviews get out was supposed to be a horrorcomedy but i got maybe three chuckles out of it the only guy who was close to being funny was the tsa agent almost nothing was scary damn i could have seen skull island instead

that said everyone else in the theater seemed to love the movie and there was some subtle humor that i thought was well done still i found it very monotonous

theres nothing new or refreshing about this horrible movie its no better than a wwii nazi propaganda film theres no social commentary in this atrocious excuse of a movie but its definitely riddled with racist agitprop its like an sjws version of orwells animal farmblack people goooodwhite people baaaad instead of creating a film that would help revitalize a quickly stagnating genre jordan peele has created nothing more than a piece of propagating filth rather than trying to make a film showing the unity of the human race he drives a wedge of contention between the racesfurther fueling bigotry and hate its pompousness and arrogance that strokes the flames not genius if i could rate this drivel less than  i would stay far far away from this

46,46," get out no really get out

so i went to see the movie get out with some friends yesterday we had a choice between leggo batman and get out and we chose get out were still arguing about who should be blamed for that choice they list it as a horror what they dont tell you is that the horror is that someone would even make this movie ive never seen any of jordan peeles movies before this i will spend the rest of my life trying to avoid ever seeing one of his movies again the thing strives to be one of those sixth sense what a twist movies but the so called twists are so obvious unrealistic and just flat out lame that you find yourself rolling your eyes in the dark and just praying that no more twists are coming and they always are if you were to take the racial premise in this movie and reverse it there would be pickets and riots but apparently its perfectly acceptable to have a white people are evil and black people are good movie just for the record im only part white but im fully offended by the premise of this movie not to mention in the clumsy and lazy execution that doesnt bother to try to make its plot points make any sense to be fair the trailer to get out does hint that this could either be a very good movie or one of the worse that youve ever seen it comes far close to the latter and is too lazy to ever even approach the former possibility this movie really does suck it sucks despite some very good actors including catherine keener who has been superb in indie films like your friends and neighbors and bradley whitford an aaron sorkin favourite the lead actor daniel kaluuya was even in the wonderful british series the fades and skins and yet the net result the only result is just flat out stupid and predictable maybe the title get out is meant as a warning to any potential audience but probably not that would require too much effort and self awareness but the rest of us can try to help each other out in these days when going to the movies is more expensive in most places than drugs and gives you far less pleasure when in comes to get out please please for your own stakes stay out go see leggo batman i havent seen it but i wish i had",negative,1

48,48," get out is full of touches and surprises strong acting excellent direction and above it its a ride a trip to a place hollywood doesnt normally go  it offers a unique experience  and in this age of copycat cookie cutter safe choice cinema it stands out by a mile

get out is that rare beast  a film that leaves you satisfied yet pondering we objected to its constant referral as a horror film  its an effective thriller with mild horror elements  but it is not a goreslasher movie  this is more about getting under the skin and inside the mind of the viewer

the plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home home is not what home seems to be fun ensues the genius of this is the way it plays on both white and black perceptions  we asked how the film would be if you reversed all the roles pretty darn effective etc

theres got to be a way to explain the hype and positive reviews about this boring movie i think its mostly because critics wouldnt dare hate on as it would label them racist

you have the feeling this is about the director up on his soapbox expressing his racism towards whites but hey its seems its ok for them to do that they get applauded for it

58,58," jordan peeles directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues the cinematography tropes and soundtrack echo horror but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isnt racist by claiming i would have voted for obama for a third term before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy it mines the horrors of racism the social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a jordan peele creation get out is simply amazing

60,60," i feel so sorry for myself after trying out this movie the reviewers gave it good scores but since this movie was injected with a million different ways to make white people look racist and tons of sexual innuendo between our handsome male lead and our resident sexy white girl i guess it would have been politically incorrect for reviewers to have even a microscopic sized spine to criticize it i mean hell are you into like toenail fetishes femdom you might like a scene or two but the rest will give you cancer

i can honestly say this movies writing is worse than anything ive seen before twilight yeah its worse the acting is almost as bad especially from the supporting cast but really its just everything about the writing i bet i could have written a better film when i was in th grade i am writing this review so that you dont waste your time please dont waste your time please avoid like the plague not worth even  star piece of horse crap of a film

61,61," jordan peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo key  peele so when i first heard the news that hed written and directed a horror film i would be lying if i said i wasnt a little surprised then came reports that get out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and after horror having a solid year in  i was hoping itd live up to expectations believe the hype guys because get out is as good as youve heard

black photographer chris washington daniel kaluuya and his white girlfriend rose armitage allison williams visit roses parents for the weekend where they will meet chris for the very first time staggered by their behaviour from the very off chris begins to think all is not right in the home of dean bradley whitford and missy armitage catherine keener

i absolutely loved get out as both a psychological and satirical horror jordan peeles imagination bringing us something quite unique within the genre and showing that he has such a big future ahead as a filmmaker right from the opening sequence which is one of the best openings to a horror ive seen i knew this film was going to be special it felt almost as if i was watching a film from a seasoned director and not a man making his directorial debut peele exuding confidence more and more as the film rises through the levels of paranoia

the writing is spot on as well peeles background as a comedian coming into great use to blend the satire so perfectly with the horror peele has clearly made get out as a form of social commentary but he does so by keeping the audience on their toes wondering where the film will turn next which is one of the most important aspects of a horror film as well as being genuinely creepy get out also has some hilarious moments up its sleeve leaving the audience in the palm of peeles hand

peeles confidence as a filmmaker is seen further through toby olivers swift cinematography akin to work seen in the shining and both michael abels haunting score and songs picked by peele to accompany his twisted film

coming to the performances get out excels above many horror films with a talented and strong cast daniel kaluuya leads the film with a quite exceptional performance as chris washington impressing with each passing minute as the paranoia within his character grows expect to see much more of kaluuya in the future

bradley whitford and catherine keener are both devilishly charming and unnerving with their performances as roses parents who take an immediate interest in chris life both past and present get out gets its truly unsettling performances from betty gabriel and marcus henderson as georgina and walter hired by deans father they both have a standout scene where it becomes clear that all is not well with either them or the house they tend to lil rel howery deserves a mention too for being genuinely funny in the role of chris best friend rod who doesnt just feel like the comedy relief shoehorned in for the sake of it

get out brilliantly continues the resurgence of the horror genre and as a directorial debut has to go down as of the best ive seen from jordan peele hes already stated that this is the first of a number of horrors he has planned which will act as social commentaries and if they continue to be as good as his debut i cannot wait",negative,1
62,62," bad cringe worthy acting stereotypical behavior which is insulting to black people the movie expects all black man apparently to act like thugs among another calling each other brother and giving fist bumps and calling women bitches full of product placement all the computers and phones used in the movie are from the same brand low level of humour transformers movie level which does appeal to the mass audience but not any self respecting intelligent human being very boring keeps you waiting for something to happen it is all a mess

66,66," actually if were not talking about characters in the movie but the viewers of the movie i urge you to stay and watch this is a clever horror comedy that does play with the viewers expectations and is also a powerful message you could almost say a social commentary but its really about having fun at the movies

and one character especially is very entertaining and does everything he can to keep things light the combination of being funny but also scary is a difficult one but the movie walks that fine line very nicely some people took issue with the theme and the bad guys in this and how or rather what they represented but if you really have issues with that than the issue lies within yourself its a completely different thing not liking a movie because youre just not into it and one arguing it is unfair to you in its depiction  youve revealed much about yourself id say

it was about time someone made a movie like this and it sets a pretty high standard great script great performances a nailbiter ",negative,1

70,70," the genius of this movie was all the hype about it and the sheep who fed the hype i looked at a few sites to see what it was rated and figured my wife and i like some psychological horror why not genius movie on an epic level for me even though i rated it  star out of  the true genius of this movie is showing to my wife and i how alone we are in this worldcountry and that were surrounded by a minority of actual humans but now a majority of sheep i am so honored to have watched this movie to now see so clearly this visceral portrait of americas idiocy unfolding

when the movie ended and it faded to black and those powerful words get out came up i knew right then and there that this blockbuster of a movie had finally solidified my mind into knowing i am surrounded by imbecilic sheep out there i had once doubted and thought maybe it was my age of  starting to show through and thinking man am i getting old is this how it starts but this movie transcends all age restrictions stupidity and zombielike hype needs no age no race no culture  it can shuffle forward slowly like a plague and consume more and more as we tick tock through the years to come

71,71," get out is fantastic

when i first saw the trailer for get out i laughed hard i thought it looked awful because the trailer was so weird and strangely cut i was wrong

heres what the movie did well

get out is the best movie ive seen so far in  the story follows an africanamerican man visiting his white girlfriends house but there is so much more than just that the story is incredibly entertaining the dialogue kept the audience entertained it was funny witty smart and kept a constant pace the movie blended horror and comedy perfectly neither taking center stage the film has a lot of dark humor which im a huge fan of it worked very well with the setting and tone of the film the story has twists and turns that are very original and catches the audience off guard the story has fantastic social commentary commenting on subtle racism throughout which is very effective the story keeps the audience on the edge of their seat throughout when the comedy hits it hits hard each joke hit and were well timed the horror hits hard as well making the film disturbing and creepy when it needs to be

the technical things in this movie were amazing the lighting was consistent and gave the film a dark stylized and disturbing vibe the cinematography was fantastic each shot giving off a certain feeling which helped move along the story the music that played in this movie helped with the vibe fitting whatever scene it was in

most everyone who acted in this movie gave a fantastic performance daniel kaluuya bradley whitford and lilrel howery particularly giving great performances everyone embodied their characters perfectly and put a lot of effort into making sure their characters were believable

this film was jordan peeles directorial debate if this type of quality holds up in his future films i can see him having a long and successful career in directing the film is well paced and makes sure to keep the audience on their seat peele made sure to get fantastic performances out of his actors and did a great job creating the tone for this movie

onto the bad which there arent a lot

there was out of the whole movie one shot i didnt like there was a shot with fire in frame the fire didnt look real which took me out of the story for a split second

caleb landry joness performance was a little over acted if he acted less like a cartoon character it would have been better but it doesnt effect the movie in a major way

overall jordan pelles get out is fantastickeeping the audience on the edge of their seat when they need to be and made them laugh when the jokes hit the film is beautiful looking and the story is unique and will surprise many audience members i highly recommend get out if your looking for a quality horrorcomedy movie",negative,1
72,72, nervous about meeting his caucasian girlfriends parents a young african american struggles to work out if everyone is acting strangely around him or if it is just his imagination in this unusual mystery thriller the film is very deliberately paced with lots of malice foreshadowed but exposition only revealed in tiny chunks along the way in fact utterly unsettling as the precredits sequence is it is hard not to wonder whether the film would have been better without it since it is the only scene for quite a while that spells out the horror slant of get out beneath its quirky fa√ßade that said there are enough elements that remain elusive here that the film stays enticing until the end the final quarter also comes off as a very clever homage to the horror movies of the s complete with appropriate furniture for the period what really elevates the film though is its social satire the racism agenda is a little onthenose but the protagonists anxiety at being a token african american really clicks forced to enter into awkward conversations with several houseguests at one point who have no idea how to talk to him without sounding racist it is actually quite a universal predicament and aside from being a captivating mystery movie get out also pinpoints how strange it can be to interact in an environment when one is a minority whether it be by race religion gender age or other factors,negative,3

86,86," get out is a decent horror movie better than average but not without its set backs it absolutely didnt deserve an oscar let alone for screenplay but its not the worst choice in the world at the end of the day for a debut film this is pretty admirable and could mean a lot for horror movies black people and the general film industry but aside from the politics of the film it really is just an ok horror

the vvitch and it follows are much much better horror films deserving of much more praise but because this horror film has a discussion about race it gets millions of dollars and awards and praise is this a bad thing

not really its better than giving an award to something like another shat out blumhousejames wan sequel with no talent or effort put into it

basically the best thing about the film is the actors and their performances especially daniel kaluuya who is as excellent as always

the worst thing about the film would probably have to be the horror elements since its incredibly one note and unoriginal in this department not saying its bad but it doesnt do anything the horror genre hasnt seen a bunch of times already

its good not great but still kinda cool a horror film won an oscar since the last was in  with the sixth sense",negative,3

88,88," i just wasted nearly two hours of my life watching one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen i had heard great things about it it sounded like an interesting concept and to be fair it does start off very well and draws you in young chris washington an amiable fellow whos a professional photographer goes to spend the weekend with his white girlfriends family  hes nervous as most young men are when meeting their girls family and that his girl hasnt disclosed his race to her parents puts him even more on edge at first blush her parents are typical uppermiddle class professional pseudoliberals  even without what follows theyre not at all likable  the young woman has a brother who looks like white trash gets drunk at the family dinner that evening and in his passiveaggressive way really wants to kick the crap out of chris theres an extended family gathering that weekend  which makes poor chris even more anxious but he outwardly calm and unflappable and is a good sport if only to please his girlfriend

i wont disclose what happens next  but the story just devolves into abject stupidity pointless in my view violence and a denouement that is anticlimatic i couldnt wait for this film to be over  for a film that got off to such an interesting and promising start i was greatly disappointed

if the message here is that white people have a desire to continually subjugate blacks meh  as a white man i cant even take umbrage at that because a im not sure thats what jordan peele is trying to assert and b in its execution its just plain silly and mindless

nota bene  i rented this from netflix on bluray  there was a very clear message that if you want to see the bonus features which looked very interesting you had to own the dvd  the netflix copy was a nofrills movie only copy  really is this something new or universal being withholding and just plain idiotic speaking for myself i cant recommend this film  its a cut above a madefortelevision feature  it tries in its way to bring a rosemarys baby suspense to it and it just fails miserably in that regard  perhaps they were aiming a bit too high",negative,4
89,89, despite my rating i dont hate this film i find it to be an unspecial movie that doesnt know if its a horror or comedy one surprisingly jordan peele has some film knowledge and it shows a couple of times in the film for example the opening or the hypnosis scenes overall this movie is decent on a technical aspect but what ruins it is the script full with plot holes and clich√©s and nonsense the movie is just stupid it tries to be more than what it is introducing social and political commentary first of all im not american im mexican and second i dont care about what happens in the usa for me a movie that says that racism is bad and white people are bad will not have an impact on me i dont hate white people like a lot of americans im not a sjw and i dont sympatize with black people because they are the most racist towards latin americans believe or not so the fact that this movie has this message doesnt make it good letting this aside we just have another generic horror movie with stupid jumpscares and stupid characters and bad acting except daniel kaluuya he does a good job and a stupid script we know why this won an oscar because is a movie made by black people if you genuiney like this film thats ok good for you but please dont go around hating and calling people racist because they dont agree with you,negative,1

132,132, its very refreshing to enjoy a masterpiece obviously this is an art piece just because horror and comedy dont get labelled as art very often doesnt mean it isnt possible why the movie doesnt care what you have to say about it it just wants to be itself get its message through which it does in brilliant fashion so many layers in this movie will inspire you to reflect on people and society from a fresh perspective the leads performance and character development is the kingpin holding it all together here you get a brilliantly subtle portrayal of a well fleshed out main character im not a fan of key  peele so i resisted watching the flick out of expectation that the humour would turn me off so glad i gave in and watched it as this film in fact presents a well balanced thoughtful and expertly wielded theme one which most are too fearful to touch with a ten foot pole it must be tough to create a clear focused vision with topics that are so controversial but clearly there is much more to peele than the lighthearted comedian for here he has have crafted and directed a bold mature and most of all important piece of cinema all the while the horror is still good horror and the humour is still good humour smart very very smart,positive,9
134,134," i just recently rewatched this movie and im happy i did because there are so many details i didnt realize during my first watch but i did realize during the second time which made it even more fun to watch and a better film overall

get out is a horrorsatire that discusses the issue of racism at least certain aspects of it but it does it in a way that is not heavyhanded or preachy i like the fact that it makes fun of how white people tend to relate to black people but also how black people tend to relate to white people and even to each other at the same time it has some genuine moments that show the difficulties black people can have in a whitemajority environment nowadays people can be labeled a racist even for ridiculous reasons especially in the us which is a very unhealthy tendency in society and if thats something that bothers you as well let me assure you get out is not a film of that spirit its goal is not to make white people feel guilty this movie is smart funny but it also has heart and is honest about the topic

acting directing writing and cinematography are great across the board the two best performances in my opinion are that of daniel kaluuya who plays the main character and lakeith stanfield who plays a smaller role but is fantastic in that

get out is thrilling creepy funny sometimes overthetop and even though it was released back in january for me as of september   it is still the best movie of the year

137,137," discrimination in all its possible variables is a matter of which its possible to get very far both in extension and intellection an issue that has touched various media in terms of attacking this puppet of such evil purposes basing on a sadpopular behavior such as racism in the united states of today filmmaker jordan peele‚Äîwho gained status by tv shows of a comic nature that with the accustomed dubious quality achieved american transcendence‚Äîpresents a sour fiery and impetuous social satire brimming with black humor with delicious psychological thriller hint that arrives in order to impact strong on a certain welloff sector thanks to a reflective tale of the big little lies that we tell each other in such a clever effective and commercial way that might well gets it a list of meritorious titles as cult film or the best suspense movie of the year and maybe a round of accolades for its splendid components identical in quality different in appearance

peeles feature film converges in not few vertices with the laudable allegorical representation the invitation  by american filmmaker karyn kusama highlighting as the main concomitant the essence of the true thriller: increasing discomfort and vulnerability sown in order to audience does not feel secure with what happens on the screen which provokes in this incessant birth of perceptions toward the loaded questions posed by the story a genre equivalent to a perverse roulette in which in the slightest moment of carelessness a rush of revolutions can shake your safety from head to toe such concordance adorned with an acute social criticism substantial of the authentic films inaugurated by mr hitchcock in which are exhibited the poorest actions that we can come to commit were the black and white dots

while it builds outstanding psychological game with detailedness peele deserving of double mention acting as scriptwriter and director conjures up ordinary components and other unusual that can be abridged in three major fields: the first one of course is the narrative although beyond wise skill of developing the subliminal core idea its the successful combination and harmonization between two discordant genres as horror and comedy an impressive achievement especially in the decadent film period in which we are in while comedy is based on the supporting comic relief gags contradictory and stereotypical a black man and the irony of the situations its fascinating as horror doesnt require scary monsters or spooky entities to fulfill its objective although there are here terror springs up from dread and the veiled significance of the words from confrontation with the harsh reality the second one is plausible constituents at a technical level namely its miseensc√®ne soundtrack cinematography and photography that unite the vertiginous final act with the hesitant first act using as usual in jason blums company precise elements that facilitate and enrich the following of the story its prodigious in the composition of its images having in its power a vacation home encircled by a dry forest is not a break on the contrary its sensational as they create beauty usually in confined spaces with what they have with certainty the film has conceived one of the most beautiful shots in horror film history an oneiric picture where chris daniel kaluuya jolts awake after a cyclic hypnosis in a pale leather sofa with the sound effect from an old tv as the only company his face‚Äîtremendously photographic‚Äîraises an analogy through the melodramatic tears in his exorbitant eyes a frame that will last in the memory of any modern cinephile there are also sparkling scenes which reach horns of the moon in its exciting third act highlighting vigorously camera focus in the third major factor: the overwhelming and heterogeneous performances kaluuyas role radiates power and strength hes sensitive and unprotected when he needed aggressive and lethal when everything is a disaster the alienation of the armitage family is dosed between the competent actors from which stand out allison williams with a twisted plot worthy of shyamalan and her brother in the fiction interpreted by caleb landry jones exclusive attention requests scene stealer betty gabriel who plays a couple of shocking scenes with dimensions of complexity and interpretative depth typical of an acting matron be careful because this lady and kaluuya will present great surprises

conscious of its game peeles motion picture is a deliberate subversion offered by the hand of cinema which cries out for the eradication of injustices perpetuated by the social and political sects of the trump era it also breaks supposed barriers between genres and ideas and overflows creativity and power by creating situations as exciting as cartoonlike as intelligent as reflexive a satire that wasnt requested perhaps out of fear but in the end it came with a relentless purpose it achieves what many feature films dont: surprise and affect",positive,9
139,139," as you will see from the film trailer meeting the parents and their neighbours etc can be a very daunting task especially when you feel you may have your doubts about them liking you so when chris meets his girlfriends parents he finds them to be nice well actually too nice in fact he becomes concerned there is something a little too nice and a little too weird worth watching it isnt scary although there are a few things that would make it unsuitable for younger viewers

141,141," get out is jordan peeles directorial debut and its about a young black man whose white girlfriend takes him to meet her parents there is a lot racism going on and he starts getting more and more paranoid

i really cant describe the plot of this movie very well without spoiling too much and thats because of the one problem i have with this movie:awkward pacing its a bit of a slowburn until the very end and then everything is resolved very quickly its still welldone and intense yes but the pacing makes the whole thing feel a bit off there is also a comic relief character that was given way too much to do he wasnt annoying he was actually pretty funny but his constant appearing gave us some way too sudden tonal shifts now while im saying all this it probably sounds like i didnt like the movie but i really did i didnt think it was perfect but it was an interesting ride

the premise itself is pretty smart i just felt that more could be done with more psychological parts of the movie even though the plot structure isnt the best the dialogues are very well written and backed up by very strong performances main character is well developed and you really care about him which makes the whole situation even more intense through the first two acts not much really happens but you cant help but feel that sense of dread then things go down actually it has a similar structure to the wicker man just with a less disturbing ending

this movie has its flaws but that didnt stop me from enjoying it because it won me over with an intense atmosphere and nail biting climax",positive,9

145,145, film fans might avoid the movie get out because it looks like another drama about a black man a white woman and the way they are treated in the inter racially unfriendly deep south however they will quickly discover that director jordan peele has twisted this theme of racial ethnicity into a bizarre and intense psychological thriller the story revolves around chris washington daniel kaluuya a young black photographer who is dragged by his white girlfriend rose armitage allison williams to her parents traditional gathering of wealthy white family and friends chris is well aware of the hostility he might encounter from the white folks in alabama but he isnt prepared for the unnatural behaviour of the black people he encounters especially the gardener marcus henderson and the maid betty gabriel whom rose ironically insists are part of the armitage family roses father dean armitage bradley whitford walks chris through the family history and discloses some interesting facts roses grandfather while his wife missy catherine keener corrals chris into a discussion about hypnosis and her ability to cure people of their disgusting smoking habit all the while stirring a cup of tea with her spoon everything seems benign in the armitage family until roses brother jeremy caleb landry jones reveals his true racial prejudice although missy quickly puts him back in line the next day chis is introduced to several guests attending the gathering who share their admiration for particular traits of black race the physical strength the athletic ability and the fashionable appeal but when he notices the one black guest resembles an old acquaintance named dre lakeith stanfield who mysteriously disappeared from the neighbourhood several years ago chris calls his new york friend rod lilrel howery who investigates the matter and eventually comes to rescue him from this horrible nightmare get out will certainly prove to be one of the great psychological thrillers and deserves its high imdb rating,positive,9

151,151," debuting director jordan peele knows how to handle his budget universal pictures who were smart enough to pick up the movie for distribution can be quite pleased with the turnout: with  million in production budget the movie has already returned  million and its still counting at the box office worldwide one thing is for sure: director peele knows how to balance between the swamp of horror clich√©s and a sketchy almost overthetop humour reminding to some extent of edgar wright but he also gives his comedy horror another dimension by playing with the conventions of whitesandblacks relations

great directorial debut from jordan peele who also wrote the script peele was one half of the hilarious comedy duo key and peele so you would be excused for thinking that his first movie would be a comedy get out is not a comedy it starts as a social commentary and ends as a horrorthriller

in both respects it is great though i preferred the social drama aspect more some very clever observations regarding race relations in the first half of the movie and i imagine a fairly accurate depiction of the africanamerican experience as a horrorthriller the build up and plot development is very good but the ending felt a bit too easy and rushed the conclusion is also not very profound which is a bit disappointing after all the social observations that came before

this said the ending would be the only weak spot and it only appears weak because the rest of the movie was so good

peele does throw in some comedy moments via the character of rod williams and these are great

solid performances all round daniel kaluuya as chris is probably the best of lot lilrel howery as rod williams almost steals the show though

153,153," i wanted to see a horror film and i picked up this one though it is not horror in my opinion i am not disappointed on the contrary this was really interesting film

i can not really comment on all racial things concerning this film as i come from place where there are no such differences in race but i do understand what the film wanted to say in that matter

the whole film from the moment the couple enters the house feels like a modern episode of twilight zone the atmosphere the fakeforces smiles of the maid the unusual behaviour of the gardener the hypnosis scenes

must say that the main couple did a great job they were really convincing in their roles parents a bit less or maybe it is just the way their roles were supposed to brother was crazily spooky during the dinner and after

the time of my life song was lol while she was picking up the next victim

157,157," lets start by saying this is pretty much the best movie i have seen this year the story is great easy to get into it and unsettling

starting with the basic the acting was top notch the girl kind of fall flat at the end but other than that great all around main and support and even the one liner are very good

the setting and the camera work was great yet again only one thing that to me made no sense but it is minor the rest was perfect in my opinion

the story was fun for everyone if you are a black person you will see an exaggerated version of things that might happen if you are not the movie does a great job in putting you in his shoes back to the story t starts slow but not boring and ramps up fast it keeps you guessing to be honest i was expecting something very different as a plot twist but the way they went works i found one hole in the story i cant explain but i am guessing it is explain in the extended or deleted scenes there is no jump scare no cheap gimmick only a good story that keeps you in suspense

i dont know how to explain it with no spoiler but you need to watch this if horror is not your type of movie this is still a great movie for you it is more of a thriller movie with a horror story

worth it",positive,5
158,158," spoiler alerts spoiler alerts spoiler alerts read no further if you dont want the plot ruined for you

i heard a lot about this film and that it was an excellent horror movie with a relevant social message i looked eagerly forward to seeing it and now that i have i can honestly say that i am very disappointed with the film after  minutes i was going to turn it off but i kept hanging on to see when and if anything interesting would happen and what the fuss was all about it took a long time for anything of note to happen most of the plot action takes place in the last  or  frenzied minutes

more spoiler alerts spoiler alerts spoiler alerts read no further if you dont want the plot ruined for you

if anyone has ever seen the classic universal studios  horror comedy abbott and costello meet frankenstein then youll know the plot for get out coincidentally released by universal studios borrowed liberally ie was ripped off from that ac movie this time instead of dracula wanting to transplant costellos simple mind brain into the frankenstein monster so the monster will be malleable and compliant we have rich old white folks wanting to have their brains transplanted into young healthy black peoples bodies with stronger bodies so the white folks can live longer and be healthier i guess its some kind of twisted sicko old rich white persons idea of the fountain of youth or fantasy utopia duh go figure the idea makes you wonder what the families of the old rich white people do about their elderly family members death certificates and how they cover up the missing old rich white family members in the outside world no one seems to ever miss them or question the new black family members

get out clocks in at a slowly paced one hour and  minutes but if you watch the first  minutes and skip to the last  frenzied minutes where all the improbable action takes place and i mean very improbable youll save yourself  hour and  minutes of snooze time virtually nothing happens for that long stretch in between

one more spoiler alert: the ending you can drive a mack truck through the improbable happenings and ridiculous overkill it would be one hell of a messy situation to clean up and walk away from

the biggest peeve i have is the guys loving white girl friend ie kidnapper who lures young black people to her parents home in secluded upstate ny she actually leaves the light on in her closet with a shoe box lid ajar for the suspicious black boyfriend to find its smack dab in the middle of the closet floor light shining on it with nothing else around the contents  oh just many photos of his girl friend with every black boyfriend and one girl friend she has lured to her parents home there must be at least  to  of those victims each pictured lovingly with her a very busy family industry theyve got going there why would she do that answer: as a plot device to hammer it home to the boyfriendvictim and to the viewing audience in case you couldnt figure out what was happening already

in the end get out is an inferior horror movie that would have made a poor  minute episode of the twilight zone way back in the day

social message i dont think so unless you want to read one into it

more likely it exploits the racial divide in some parts of society to garner ticket sales for the studio

in the end like so many other poor horror movies get out seems like the idea one gets from a crazy mixed up nightmare after eating too much greasy pizza late at night

recommendation: skip get out  pardon the pun it is a no brainer ha ha ha",positive,5
159,159," i enjoyed most of the film the suspense  thriller  mystery side of it until it came to the part when i realize it is a copy of another film which is also a copy of another film dont get me wrong i enjoy watching remakes from the same novel but surely it has to end somewhere the actors were semi ok the main actor was terrible he wasnt sure where to look most of the time

an alright mystery thriller for all ages though id give it  if i hadnt seen the same plot used so many times already

162,162," jordan peeles strong directorial debut got well deserved oscar attention as its unique intelligent and often times subtle storytelling made for a well layered suspenseful film experience

it is hard to say one actor out of the supporting roles stuck out as they all performed so well but daniel kaluuya in the lead role as chris was superb his usage of facial expression and body language played so well to his character and in a movie with plenty of good qualities about it he shines

jordan peele also uses a lot of subtle imagery that contributes well to the themes and tone of his story which is notably impressive especially for a first time director and make for rewarding second third and maybe even more repeat viewings

this movie is not without faults however as there is a handful of times where characters inexplicably act strange seemingly just for the audience and like most horror movies coming out recently it has its pointless shrill music stabs to emphasize a silly jump scare

despite its faults i would still highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an intriguing story",positive,8

165,165," get out is easily the best movie of  managing to get the highly coveted  on rotten tomatoes once i finally decided to watch the movie it was easy to see why

the basic idea behind the plot is this man chris daniel kaluuya has decided to go spend the weekend with his girlfriend rose allison williams and her parents in an isolated home in alabama but as the weekend progresses and without revealing too much of the plot chris begins to discover something truly sinister

jordan peele the director and writer crafts this horror film so delicately being sure to reveal things slowly and carefully as the film progresses the plot is simply so original unique and ingenious and credit is due to jordan peele for all his decisions he has us viewers believing one thing for the majority of the film only to dash that aside for a far more sinister truth this horror movie uses so many common horror tropes and yet it expertly embraces and twists them into what truly is a masterpiece

the film also centres around racism primarily the more subtle liberal type that has arisen in society in modern times jordan peele intertwines this message of racism so delicately throughout the film and even though its a horror movie theres plenty of poignant commentary of the state of racism today

personally what i loved about the movie was the pacing which allowed subtle hints to be sprinkled throughout the movie before the dramatic sinister reveal i also loved kaluuyas acting it was so raw and believable and it really had you convinced of the true horror of what was going on throughout the film every second of the film we see his character responding and coming to terms with everything going on around him its genius

there were a few things that i didnt love about the film but theyre mostly plot related and i dont want to give spoilers in my opinion its not the perfect movie but its so close the difference is honestly negligible its especially remarkable given that jordan peele is a first time director everything about this film  the writing the acting the pacing  is so clever and there is praise due to everyone who worked on this movie it really does prove that the world of hollywood still has plenty more ideas to explore yet",positive,9
167,167," once in a while a movie comes along that takes a genre by the scruff of the neck and vigorously shakes it into a new shape

this is so with get out a horror movie so the marketing blurb says that lobs a few horror tropes into a lean and mean  minute thriller but it is really a social observation on the insidiousness of racism it comes out the other end as a unique movie offering

it borrows from pacific heights psycho michael hanekes astonishing party games and subhorrorporn like saw without ever being any of them

without resorting to spoilers its one gigantic twist from start to finish that realises the fears of a young black american guy on a trip to the country to meet his wealthy wasp girlfriends family on a celebration weekend every sentence uttered by every character becomes a retrospective clue as to what the outcome will be

given its described as a horror you can expect a deal of nasty stuff in a climactic ending what director and screenwriter jordan peele amazingly a debut outing most cleverly does is apply hitchcockian tension so that  minutes of tension are realised in a mere  minutes of terror in such a way that the nasty bits dont as so often is the case outstay their welcome

superb performances all round from the five principal actors but especially boyfriend and girlfriend daniel kaluuya and allison williams girls

its should be no surprise that this has been both bafta and golden globes nominated but it is because this genre rarely reaches this level of critical acclaim

itll get oscar nods too",positive,9

173,173," when you think of the oscars you think of big sweepy dramas like saving private ryan or big extravagant musicals like chicago but when was the last time you thought of a horror movie for best picture if you cant remember any its because horror movies rarely made the cut much less win the best picture award past nominees from this genre includes the exorcist jaws sixth sense black swan the silence of the lambs the only winner so far and now we have a new addition to this prestigious list: get out

get out tells the story of chris whos whisked away for the weekend by his girlfriend so he can meet her parents his nerves are understandable because aside from the possible awkward and tense first meeting factoring in their interracial relationship he doesnt just worry if theyll like him for who he is but also for what he is an africanamerican the feeling of uneasiness never escaped him as later his nervousness is converted to fear for his life when things start to unravel as to what the true purpose of the trip was for

i browsed the reception of the movie and its praises all around and is one of the most buzzed about nominee this year of its four nominations picture actor director screenplay i would have to agree most with the best actor nod for daniel kaluuya who i remember and loved from one of my favorite black mirror episodes:  million merits and just yesterday hated in a good way as wkabi in black panther while he wont probably win there wasnt enough that can be done with the role compared to timothee chalamets elio or gary oldmans churchill those scenes were he cries on point just takes your breath away as for the rest of the nominations it might just be me but i dont get the extreme love for it which includes a  rating on rotten tomatoes i get that its breaking barriers the symbolism some of which i got only after reading up on the movie but to me its just another horror movie maybe ive seen too much of blumhouse production movies such as all purge installments insidious sinister and paranormal activity thats why im lumping it with the rest of them it might win due to its popularity but if were talking overall production it doesnt hold a spoon pun intended for those whove seen it at least against cmbyn and darkest hour",positive,5

183,183," this film is so much more than your standard horror movie if anything its much more a suspense movie with a devious twist the plot is simple enough at first girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family sure basic enough but jordan peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic

the interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughters black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily what peele does is merge those two and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringeworthy no matter what race you may be if youre white the white people are embarrassing you if youre black youre feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this and wondering if there isnt something underneath the apparent good words

in that way peele encapsulates our society white people invoking barack obamas name as though it gives them credibility among black people for instance through each scene you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop and wonder what exactly it means when it happens

when it does the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo peele has as such built a perfectly frightening movie and with its deep societal roots it is intelligent and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place

the acting is stupendous and the twists are crazy good the comic relief that rod provides as a goofy tsa agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that peele is but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of chriss plight

 see this movie and see it often",positive,10
184,184," excellent horror movie it has many spoofs nonsense  unlikely events however the story line is so original and characters are so freaky that its overshadowed jordan peele surprised everybody with this master piece mix of horror and black comedy yet raising the racism issue to a total uncharted territory outstanding performances by kaluuya and williams special recognition to betty gabriel

186,186," i wont even bother telling you the premise im sure you know it what i will say is that this has extremely tight writing the plot twists hold up i cant think of a single plot hole and im one of those people who obsessively tears apart films looking for those i dont usually have to even try

i have a mixed race family and i say its extremely relevant politically racially in todays world its not an antiwhite film its not calling all white people racist or anyone racist its just probably using some dialog the writerdirector has probably heard a million times in conversations with white people in high society

its not a horror movie as its listed on imdb and by most viewers it has some horror elements but its really a suspense movie and its a very good one because for the first half of the movie or more you have a growing sense of dread and you have no idea why to top it off it has some very funny parts but they dont ruin the suspense because the funny man is on the other end of a phone the protagonists only link to the outside world as it were and so it is compartmentalized and doesnt diminish the very real threat he is facing",positive,9
187,187, i am by no means a professional troll here to say that my opinion is relevant however this movie was fantastic but again that is just my  cents for a debut in directing especially when its jordan peele i was awestruck not for my lack in trust in his ability but this was a horrorthriller and i have known his work for always being something more along the lines of side splitting hilarity i heard he directed this film often times doing his impressions of president obama how i miss thee and his other well known impressions i also hear that jordan took notes from the late and great george a romero in creating the story around a black man as the protagonist which really how often do we see that always refreshing to see a new perspective in an old genre if you really want to see a new look unto meeting the family of your significant other watch this movie especially if you are wasting your precious times reading reviews like mine and others take the  mins or so and sit back the soundtrack also worth listening i give it a  out of  this is nothing like keanu but its still a great movie kukdos mr jordan peele i was already a fan but now i am much cooler xo,negative,2

190,190," this is no perfect movie but it shouldnt be criticized strictly for racism the fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes their motivations are really quite personal and self serving but unless you are willing to accept that this can be done then its no movie much science fiction is based on things that are impossible the bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason but the plot says they do peele uses black humor excuse the term but i mean it in the general sense and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story i thought it was unique interesting and entertaining

191,191, a mind is a terrible thing to waste of course we have all heard this one and brushed it off as just another whimsical inconsequential cliche tossed around in the maze of social interaction but there is whole new depth brought to this phrase by jordan peeles independent horror film get out we are met in the film by chris daniel kaluuya discussing with his girlfriend rose allison williams the plans for the weekend stay at his girlfriends family estate immediately the issue of race is involved when chris asks do they know im black which is met with the reassurance of rose that this wont be an issue when at the estate there is nothing intrinsically wrong but at the same time everything has an odd sense to it our nerves are settled with the line i would have voted for obama a third time if i could delivered by roses father but our intention is immediately recaptured by the oddity of the groundskeeper trimming the grass with a old school rotary lawn mower this is completely intentional and complete genius by peele as no other emphasis is put on that mower but it all gets explained after the big reveal however in the time it is just playing into the motif of the horror film this horror film offers much more than your typical jump scare and tantalising suspense though it does those well too this movie contains layers upon layers of social and racial intentions and stereotypes but again it portrays these in a rather unusual and original manner this film takes every right wing social stereotype and completely flips them on its head not a single scene nor character in this movie is wasted they all have a purpose and play an integral part in the storyline with some playing even double and triple subliminal rolls unbenounced to the viewer the movie is quick to portray the typical white cop racially profiling a black man stereotype but rose quick to interject as the hero intervening and standing up for her boyfriend in the face of the oppressive white cop at least this is what is shown and is expected to be interpreted from the scene ultimilty it is the viewer that is the one being played a fool by some tricky double acting with everything building up to the main reveal many family stories and tid bits are shared with chris aimed to be portrayed as the awkward stage of meeting someone new and inviting them into your home but as the pieces fall into place these interesting tales turn into rather disturbing hints it isnt until the first night of chriss stay that the viewer finally gets the first inklings to the threat surrounding chris peele sets this reveal up so brilliantly that even though he is shouting the answers to the viewer letting everyone know the truth to what is going on the viewer is not fully convinced and is still unaware of the intimate danger or at least i still was it is all explained and covered up by the answers provided to us by the scene about chriss mother and the nightmares he battles from the night she died the subliminal hints dropped through the entirety of the film are perfectly disguised within the context of the film as to not give too much away before the big reveal going into and throughout the course of movie i was expecting an overtly racist and simplistic storyline with an intriguing aspect of horror what i got was entirely different and masterfully intertwined with the social complexities that exist with minority groups rather than taking the typical approach and portraying the racism as a right wing blatantly racist film peele went the other way entirely and portrayed the racism rather as an oversensitive ignorance amongst left wing elitists you know the kind that say they would vote for obama for a third term but in reality dont have any sustainable tangible relations with any black people peele through angles lighting and mise en scene is able produce discomfort in scenes that is not reliant to the racial innuendos rather the racial insinuations add more depth to the awkwardness and tie in to the full reveal the characters still manage to come across offensive and itmindating without overtly ruining the mystique of the movie by coming across overly aggressive this film keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire  minutes with endarounds double acting and overlooked social layers for an introductory independent film peele displayed mastery of crucial aspects in the film industry allowing an entire audience to relate with chriss discomfort even if the racial and political aspects fly over your head peele uses a complex shot combining both birds eye view and worms eye view into one scene really to drive home the point while still managing to hide the big reveal suspense build throughout the movie with chriss growing paranoia the framing is excellent there are aspects of omniscient perspective where the viewer knows whats about to happen but the character doesnt it all meshes perfectly and fluently showing the viewer just enough in any one scene and then completely changing the topic to make them forget what they just saw ie the lawn mower is just one example of this all in all get out hits the mark on every aspect good horror movie ought to and then it takes it ten steps further,negative,4
193,193," after hearing all the great reviews and praises while still avoiding any spoilers i started to watch this movie prepared to love it

i found it silly

flat unsubtle and unoriginal absolutely zero scary with an unsatisfying payout and jarring changes in tone

and not really very biting in its social commentary too

the only thing positive i can say about it is that it have its heart in the right place but the execution

maybe the language of the movie failed me because im european and not american i dont know but i suspect that a good share of the praises the movie got were because its on the few that are not loaded with jarring moral values and i guess that especially in this historical moments thats quite important still i truly look forward to a future with so many movies and work of art made with social awareness and wide representation of all so that we can start praising movies that are really good in itself and that being not morally repugnant is a given not a special cause for praise",negative,1
198,198," so i will be careful about spoilers

the movie might have been interesting and i thought when i was watching the trailers it might be either some sort of underground slavery thingits notor some sort of medical horror thing where white people are using black people to harvest their organs to the highest bidderits not that either

the solution to the mystery of the film is just nonsensical and makes the drama of the entire first part of the movie feel like a cruel joke on whoever bought a movie ticket

dont waste your time on movie tickets wait til it comes out on pay per view or comes out on dvd

and no spoilers",positive,10
199,199," let me just say straight up im not a fan of horror but this film directed and written by jordan peele is very original in the storyline and themes within the movie it is really a fresh take on the genre weaving a social message without any heavy handedness without giving away the story line the movie is about an african american man with a white girl friend going home with her to visit her white parents he has the trepidation any african american would face in this situation is the family racist if so how racist will there be lots of awkward conversations about african americans the tension builds in the film as the main character played by daniel kaluuya finds things getting stranger and stranger daniel kaluuya gives an excellent performance playing the lead he provides a wonderful low key performance with great deft and subtlety

this film really deserves all the accolades

the plot was very well written however there were a few moments that confused me and there are a few glaring plot holes and certain jump scares were rather cheap and could have easily been made more subtly i personally found the ending to be quite anticlimactic and empty too but nonetheless i think get out certainly delivered the message it tried to send

202,202," i gave this movie  stars which for me is high praise indeed on my first watch i would have given it  that said now that i have viewed this title several times i can truly appreciate what jordan peele is going for its not just a black and white film and if you think it is  you miss the point

peele captures much of the ridiculousness of modern american society while also playing to those that think everything boils down to race is this is an oscar contender little o intended  who cares all the film awards do is help already narcissistic overpaid morons celebrate themselves

does this film look at some serious stereotypes while making fun of so many of things we preoccupy ourselves with yes to appreciate the humor and thrill of the film you must watch it more than once again i consider myself a very conservative individual but still appreciate the humor to be found throughout this film

if you didnt like it the first time try it again  you might find some very clever things you missed i have actually watched it about a half dozen times and find something new in every viewing",positive,7

205,205," this film was sadly lacking in every way: the story was thin and relied on cheesy explanation set ups to try and condense some sense from the slightly drunk narrative the dialogue was spare and dull i didnt hear a single laugh in the half full cinema i saw this turkey also the acting was in keeping with the story  script: awful daniel kaluuya has always appeared in good things psychoville black mirror but he cant save what ends up being a film as intense as scary movie without any laughs

get out has been described as a genrebusting film but i found it to be a sundance version of that when i say sundance i mean a cheaply made film shot in the northern us states usually in winter or fall autumn for us angloswith a dialogue driven narrative and therefore nothing of cinematographic interest nor musical

my idea of a genrebusting film would be shaun of the dead: it uses the genre of horror to drive the narrative but still has a very good script distinctive characters and an equal blend of audio  visual highlights

get out feels like a boring group of people made a film and then kidded everyone they were cool",positive,10
207,207," i think it was watching the last blair witch film that i first saw the trailer for this and while i enjoyed that film leaving the cinema it was my memories of get out that i left with im so often disappointed by films having seen wonderful looking trailers finally a movie that kills of that thinking

get out ranks as the cinematic triumph of the year for me the film was creepy poignant amusing and i think highlighted the racial problems that still exist in certain places

daniel kaluuya is an actor that sadly ive not paid a huge amount of attention too i kept asking where do i know him from a friend pointed out that as a fan of psychoville i should have known kaluuya was outstanding and ill certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on hopefully awards will follow catherine keener never disappoints she provided the scene of the film for me the therapy session providing a moment of sheer terror

somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy but the satire was definitely apparent i cant wait to pick up the bluray and enjoy it again i know the ending was changed im assuming with the possibility of a second i hope they dont this film deserved to be left alone as a true success

brilliant ",positive,8
208,208," i confess that i was slightly disturbed after this movie lol

seriously i was impressed with the script not only because of the turn of the story but also because there is a gender exchange in the middle of the movie something natural that only then you realize that it was horror that became comedy and in the end suspense and what a fantastic performance of the protagonist

209,209," jordan peeles cinematic debut is an astounding accomplishment for a genre that is commonly maligned as formulaic and inaccessible to broader audiences what may first smack as a homage to the blaxploitation horror tradition get out proves to be much more than any cliche attempt to elicit fear and unease purely through racial tension gore or cheap jump scares through the eyes of chris played by daniel kaluuya we get a small taste of what it feels like to be truly uncomfortable in ones own skin the tension is authentic building into peaks of anxiety broken by stabs of humor and sometimes the absurd as can be mr peeles inclination twists turns and a rousing climax complete an experience that wills surely engage from the opening scene to credits

i can only think of a handful of moments where i lost immersion due to clumsy dialogue or clunky cinematography overall this film is highly deserving of its oscar and i will enjoy watching it again in the future mr peele and the entire cast obviously have incredible talent and i look forward to seeing more of their work",positive,9
210,210, get out gets a lot of credit where it doesnt deserve and not enough credit where its due many have labeled it as a comedic commentary on race in contemporary american society but its really far from that yes lilrel howery is quite hilarious for most of it but get out really aims to thrill not to get laughs or cause a larger discussion on racial politics the topic of race relations from jordan peele should be no surprise considering his past comedy sketches and personal mixedrace background and marriage but his use of this material is to mainly work as a vehicle for tension and a tool to twist audience perception of what is really going on at this estate visit a blatant example of this is peeles smart directorial decision to change the original ending to one that tampers with our expectations and keeps political implications as an underlying subplot rather than the crux of the film this works very well drives the plot our imaginations and always has us wondering if our protagonist is justified in his paranoia or simply overreacting and misjudging the situation as a horrorthriller get out has a refreshingly original premise with a skillfully witty and tightly constructed narrative plot but failed to evoke enough necessary fear for its own good peele makes a decent debut as a director but predominantly and rightfully so shows off his creative storytelling chops and attention to detail but just as chris misinterprets many peoples interactions with him audiences seem to misinterpret the ultimate point of this film,positive,9
212,212," get out was very highly recommended by a friend also a fellow film enthusiast and the subject matter of the film really interested me add to that a very promising trailer the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth even with the very vocal detractors and interest was higher

high expectations were not only met but also exceeded apologies for the clich√© but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching get out can totally see why it was as well received as it was though can also see why it has divided audiences on here while it will never be one of my favourite films get out is among the better films of  and does live up to the hype

its an incredibly wellmade film visually with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to and enhances the unease and sense of dread

that the direction was done by a firsttime director is a shock in itself one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me its nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the films combative themes

being somebody who considers music important when talking about it the music looms suitably ominously and fits well get out benefits from an extremely smart and clever script though the shape of water and especially lady bird were worthier wins for the best original screenplay oscar in my view that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively

despite how it sounds get out struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements it is highly successful on this front with the thriller elements being taut suspenseful and unsettling the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy there is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still

while all the performances are very fine it is daniel kaluuyas superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most

my only complaint of get out is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and thats it note

until then the film was this close to being a masterpiece so it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction nonetheless its a great film that is among the years better ones brought down by an underwhelming ending  bethany cox",positive,7
214,214," many a cinephile might have lost all interest and hope in contemporary american films in recent years but it turns out they might have just been looking at the wrong places as the awardwinning films of the country have become duller and duller packed in a stale tight corset the most interesting auteurs have found their way in popular genre films which do not resonate that well with the businessmen who give out awards but which strike a deep chord with the general public long time comedian jordan peeles directorial debut get out  is a perfect example and it has already garnered welldeserved critical praise in france alongside the safdies good time  another genre film which might go over the heads of the critics and awardgivers who are used to the stale flow get out is definitely among the best american films of the year it should be seen by everyone not only for its social significance but also for its cinematic freshness

an africanamerican photographer chris played by daniel kaluuya travels to his white girlfriend roses played by allison williams parents to visit them for the first time at their secluded estate somewhere in upnorth countryside the friendly atmosphere of this mundane meeting starts to crack and reveal something more sinister beneath the surface

the basic setup of the plot echoes the classic civil rights era film stanley kramers guess whos coming to dinner  where a white woman introduces her africanamerican boyfriend to her liberal parents whose tolerance begins to show its limitations peele cleverly uses this intertext as a backdrop giving an undertone for the main theme but essentially develops his film into something utterly original many spectators will leave the film with the thought that they have never seen anything like this never have the monsters of horror films felt so abstract and so concrete at the same time

peele is able to derive from his comedybackground the ability to build up tension in a fashion which often borders the line of humor without directing the spectator to laughs but rather to flinches in terror although get out does not come across as a selfaware metafilm dealing with the genre of horror like it follows  peeles film does have a selfawareness to it which however never interrupts a scene or the development of suspense peele might use genre conventions with an ironic twinkle in his eye but they are never subjected to any comprehensively genrecritical discourse on the contrary the selfaware genre conventions enhance the deeply felt structure of the film whose narrative power pushes the spectators tightly into their seats

get out begins with a serene shot of a wealthy american suburb where an africanamerican man is ambling looking for the right street this image in itself mundane as its setting may be already invokes feelings of horror because we have heard of so many stories where black men end up dead in innocent places such as these it sets up an impressive and frightening sensation of not being welcomed which characterizes the film throughout peeles structured and disciplined miseensc√®ne of precise compositions beautifully articulates and exemplifies the impression of a seemingly postracial society where everything seems to be in order but which conceals secrets underneath

overall peeles get out is a real cinematic treat and most likely will acquire a following whether the film skyrockets peele to cinematic success or not will remain to be seen for it is always the second film which shows if the directors first hit was just a stroke of luck yours truly is very confident  as well as interested and hopeful for the future of contemporary american cinema",positive,7
215,215," i was pleasantly surprised by this film having not really heard of it before watching kudos to jordan peele as the writer and director of this horrormystery piece as i was indeed kept guessing throughout on several occasions my hubris got the best of me i thought i had the plot sussed  i was close but no cigar and i fully appreciated being taken down a different road than the one i had expected

a strong performance from the cast en masse but daniel kaluuya did stand out since we are essentially watching events unfold as and when he experiences them we cringe as he cringes were shocked as hes shocked and we the audience remain bonded to daniels character chris washington until the movies conclusion  and in this way we feel like we are almost in the film ourselves immersed in a strange scenario off to meet the parents but with a twist of the unusual

if you enjoy the mysteryhorror genre this film is unmissable with horror films in particular being bogged down with the same type of characters and very similar plots get out comes as a refreshing change

on the whole i would recommend it to most viewers horror fans and nonhorror fans alike  the gore is not overwhelming",positive,9

218,218," for a while i was becoming pretty convinced that it was impossible to make a movie that focuses solely on being a good movie not trying to throw in political themes or the directors private views so he could please people no just a damn good movie thats fun to watch

get out is that movie one which i have throughly enjoyed watching its a damn good horror movie because it has psychological horror about being powerless and trapped in a world you cant escape thats really powerful and its great to see a movie focus on this often unexplored psychological aspect of fear it felt like watching a really good twilight zone episode that just so happened to have a black actor in the leading role daniel kaluuya kills it as chris washington he is such a cool everyman you can really relate to this guy regardless of who you are he seems like an average chill dude who you want to hang out with this perfectly helps you relate to a character hes our outlet into the story and our way of becoming immersed in the horror

one thing that kinda frustrates me though is how everybody sees this movie for those who call it politically correct nonsense about evil white society i almost want to punch these idiots in the face this isnt something like mudbound where you instantly realize what the movie is about without even having to see it get out pushes racism and white prejudice in the background so it can focus on the story not the political climate it happens to be in people who praise or hate this movie on the grounds that it tackles racism are people who didnt get the point of the movie this movie is not about political themes but everybody thinks it is because it has white villains for those people leave your damn politics to cnn and just appreciate a movie because its great

get out is great and if you like horror movie and want a good modern horror movie give this a watch i love the classics and i will adore movies like frankenstein and brams stokers dracula to death literally but sometimes i wanna watch a modern movie where the real villains are the monsters inside the people we think we know its a great movie its really fun go watch it

 great movie that holds up well and a welcome addition to the horror community",positive,9
220,220," get out in short: an africanamerican man meets his white girlfriends parents and their friends and notices that theres something a little strange going on

racial undertones surround this really good horrormystery film directed by a guy who has a mostly comedy background jordan peele peele wades into deep waters filled with many horror greats swimming about the question is does he manage to stay afloat in this pool of great talent get out is not without a little satire but its not the cheese comedy and clich√©s you sometimes see in bad horror films it works here its smart but it is a horror film after all and a damn good one too so yes peeles floaties are working just fine

as a viewer you instantly pick up the vibe going on right from the start director jordan peele whose mother is white and father is black sets the mood early and keeps reminding you of it chris a black man is dating a white woman rose nothing unusual about that but for reasons that soon become clear a big deal is made from it rose brings chris home guess whos coming to dinneresq to an affluent neighborhood filled with old money and old white people who act as if theyve never met a real black man before suddenly the geriatrics are referring to black stereo types like im a big fan of tiger woods or is it true what they say about black men in bed people are getting creepy if not rude looking him over  sizing him up almost like cattle at an auction chris best friend rod the tsa worker and proud of it ominously warns you dont go to a white girls parents house even i began to feel sketched out

two things youll like about get out:  the story is brilliant peele also wrote the script  oscar nominee for both original screenplay and director its unique and unexpected  its the best horror film since the shining 

two things youll dislike:  you may be a little uncomfortable with the racial undertones at first perhaps even embarrassed for your entire race if youre white give the move a chance to make the point of it all  it may be a few more years until you see a horrormystery like this one again soak it up while you can",positive,7
221,221," now i dont think this film is the kind of film youll stay up all night cowering in fear wondering about what evil is lurking around the corner at least it wasnt that kind of horror film to me its more psychological and it does make you think about what its like to be black in this world and for all those saying this film is racist i dont think that was jordans intent he is married to a white woman i dont think he seriously thinks all white people are evil i see it more as not everything always appears to be as it is cautionary tale and also a bit of social commentary on those who think racism is long and dead just because there arent public lynchings anymore yes we have made strides since the civil rights moment but its still there and thats what i think the film was trying to say everything might look rosy and cheerful on the outside until you get into the thick of it and i think it was an interesting topic to handle jordan peele did a really good job of tackling it and in an new exciting way

also from a horror point the sunken place is really creepy the score also is on point its more of a slow burn but that doesnt mean its boring jordan does a good job of leaving you little clues here and there that somethings not quite right and it helps to build up to the climax

in terms of comedy lil rel howery who plays the best friend role is the comic relief he is the one that gets all of the funny lines that being said i definitely dont really consider this a comedy it never felt a comedy to me so for those that are expecting laughs you might be disappointed

daniel kaluuya though is phenomenal in this film and ill be rooting him on during awards season

overall i really enjoyed this film and im impressed that this was jordans directorial debut",positive,7
223,223," not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience yeah jordan peele had written and directed it it is similar to the s style mysterythrillers definitely must see for the s s guys it kind of looked like a black comedy but i guess thats not they had preferred especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots that freaks yet very funny

well this is the story of an interracial romance when chris decides to meet his girlfriends white family living outskirt of her hometown all goes as planned but he was not sure how her parents take it that hes a black now everything has settled but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events what it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale

the casting was amazing the story was suspenseful you would feel you can predict the scenes but not that easy and when twist happens you will realise it was simple as that this is a hit film now but if it was  years ago surely would have gotten a cult classic status and yes it is thinking the future

when this got out and its pre release i thought it would disappear without any trace it is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast debutante director and being a low cost film i got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised but i think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy thats true if you are not a film fanatic otherwise it is one of those decent films surely not to be missed one of the best of this year

225,225, get out was a giant hit a movie that many people did not know about from exploding was acclaimed by critics with one of the biggest notes of rotten and when the movie came out he had good criticism of the public but a lot of people did not find the movie all i went to watch the movie with contained expectations i did not even go with much hype but i expected something very good and at the end of the movie it was something better than i imagined without exaggerating one of the best horror movies ive ever seen is a film that has many criticisms of racism and etc and are very intelligent critics by the very promising director jordan peele the film is not terror to be scared will have some scares but nothing is too much trouble the film does not have jupscare and the the film also has a good amount of humor highlighting lil rel howery who is the comic relief of the film the cast is excellent the young daniel kaluuya is excellent alisson williams is very good too it reminded me to jennifer connelly in some moments catherine keener and etc all excellent the film also hits the dialogues that are excellent and also has many references to racism too and obviously the film is strange in several moments there are parts that you will not understand so strange the script is very round the only thing i did not like so much was a part of the end i found it clich√© well in a few moments but fortunately the movie concerts get out is a great movie one of the best movies of the year  and the biggest surprise so far i hope the film gets an indication to oscar note ,negative,1
226,226," with the large advertising budget theres a good chance youve seen the trailer and theres also a good chance you just saw the imdb trailer but i need to preface that the best viewing experience will be found if you know nothing about the story beforehand i will not talk about any specific events or characters in the movie

story: get out is a great journeytype horror movie that is most strong and reliant on its tone and buildup the movie is very good in these aspects and makes the whole narrative welldone overall because of it even withstanding a weaker ending in my opinion but that will happen with a lot of the aforementioned journeytype horror movies essentially things buildup and buildup to a certain point and the ending releases everything regardless of what the ending is like that journey is what holds the primary value ex the shining  the witch  in that sense i will leave off saying in watching this movie for its story its good but not great

cinematography: scenery and sets are really wellshot in this movie some events in the latterhalf of the film have settings that really standout especially on a second watch most of get out is shot on one property with a large house and yard surrounded by forest scenes inside the office and the basement are prevalent scenes when it comes to cinematography among others i will say that the camerawork is good overall but it doesnt utilize any elements to establish any more suspense or creepiness outside of the script and some really good acting more or less these statements apply to the formerhalf of the movie because there are some creepy shots in the latter

film score: even as a lover of music in movies i didnt feel much from this track the score is somewhat generic but wellused so it didnt impact the merit of the film but it could have earned a higher rating from me if it did standout

overall: i recommend this movie to anyone that can enjoy a good suspensefilled movie even though it is weird and a bit twisted on a superficial level its not very bad whatsoever and other than some language and yes theres some practical blood effects but that just makes the film better in my taste i would even recommend this to younger  and more general audiences alike its not a very hard r to me it definitely doesnt beat out s the witch which its most comparable to in tone but it is a very solid movie",negative,1
227,227," i was surprised by this film but not impressed acting was excellent but im not convinced the writerdirectors intent is forward thinking if anything the humor is at the expense of white people and even more insulting to biracial people what black people perceive as racist is really ignorance at its most embarrassing

so we went in all excited because of that rating thinking and hoping this would be a combination of dont breathe and house of wax but it didnt have the excitement mystery and horror of either all shockscenes are basically in the trailer the plot was shocking  there was a lot of build up  it lasted for  of the movie the last  mins of the movie were nothing  everything was rushed into and it all seemed too predictable and easy for the lead cast

231,231, get out is the first movie that ive seen at least to take the racial paranoia that is present in our culture and exploit it to make a horror film and while i was watching this film i began to realize how well jordan peele can blend comedy and horror when i was laughing and getting nervous at the same time throughout the film jordan does a fantastic job of building tension while also layering the film with his humorous point of view so that there is an atmosphere of satire all throughout the film i also have to respect that this is not an easy film to write given the touchy subject matter it could have very easily come out as racist or ignorant however the comical undertones gave the film a tongueandcheek sort of vibe and the paranoia i experienced in this film is actually one that is prevalent in our culture today and even if the racial subject matter is very touchy horror is not supposed to be kind towards our sensibilities it is supposed to take something that scares us in real life and escalate it so that it can horrify an audience for around two hours this one just happened to have a nice satirical edge to it however the film did feel short to me there were some major plot holes in the film one phenomena involving a phone that contributes to the plot in a big way is never explained the twist in the film is very entertaining however after the twist the story feels kind of rushed there does not seem to be any sense of patience or building tension it is more of just a transition from a horror movie to all of the sudden an action movie i would have liked it to be longer there is a lot of potential for more material in the film the directing in the film is really eerie and well executed i get kind of a hitchcockian vibe from his directing style there may be some influence from john carpenter in there which is hilarious given the satirical nature if the film i did not expect jordan to come off as such a seasoned filmmaker he proves that he has a knack for bringing work to the big screen and i look forward to seeing more work from jordan in the future less keanu more of this,positive,8
232,232," i didnt have any expectations about this movie i avoided reading reviews and anything just so i would be surprised unfortunately i didnt see this one on the big screen i liked the movie a lot horror it is in a certain way racism of course it is an american movie with southern story background come on this is like american clich√© right there but it is ok we all know how races is a big deal in the us it is maybe the only country where you are forced to think you have a race i mean lets not hypocrites here but in the us it really matters it is like people are curious to know what mix have you been blended with get some white black asianput in the blender and  there you are it doesnt take the originality of the movie and i dont think it is a big deal but there it is the white people talking africanamerican talkingbut it is still good

233,233," having heard nothing but raves about this film and how scary it is i caught its return to the theaters for starters ill say this get past the first  minutes because initially it comes across as cartoonish and obvious and gives no indication of how clever and brash its going to become but a sharp soundtrack early on gives a hint of something to come

this mystery story of a young couple black man and his white girlfriend meeting the latters parents in their suburban house quickly sheds its cookie cutter aura and becomes something brazen and ominous as the family members are introduced the film pulls no punches in landing one stereotypcial gag after another if youre a politically correct individual who cannot stand any kind of raciallycharged digs this film isnt for you i found the jokes to be so shameless and the satire so biting that it made a film about race relations in this day and age seem almost carefree and although it does have some isolated horror elements this is a suspense film through and through

dont get me wrong the humor aside this movie is not afraid to get its hands dirty but the outrage is really on mute this is not the kind of film that should stir up strong emotions for the simple reason that its so escapist and cheerfully juvenile at the same time despite its sheer style and witty screenplay i dont see this film winning best picture happily recommended",positive,7
234,234, when i look beyond the obvious race related message the film offers us i still see an excellent and entertaining modern day movie masterpiece get out is a creative unique and witty movie that i am so happy has gotten oscar recognition its sort of what mad max: fury road was in  in terms of an unexpected best picture nominee as it will likely lead to more original voices being heard within the mainstream cinema i can also say the same about many of the other nominees this year the shape of water and three billboards both being primary examples the subject matter the film tackles is clearly pretty heavy handed stuff and is worked into the movie quite well once you get used to it racism has almost been used as a cinematic convention at this point every year theres the new racism is bad oscar bait flick but get out pleases with its subversion of convention as get out plays provocatively around with genre at once it works as a mysterythriller a horror movie a comedy and a drama and never does a tonal shift feel wrong or out of place everything in this movie serves a genuine purpose which i have to applaud jordan peele on as i know thats not easy for a writer to really do i mean this is a brilliantly planned out film scene by scene it stuns and entertains and the  minute run time feels more like a  minute run time really impressive stuff and a directorial debut no less,positive,9
236,236," as you may guess from the submission date im reviewing get out several months after its cinematic release unfortunately the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me which no film could possibly have lived up to

this is not to say that its not good jordan peele directs well but its his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture there is such depth to it the screenplay not only with its allegories and metaphors but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings there are many layers to be unpeeled pun intended on repeat viewings

the other strength is daniel kaluuya a regular face on uk tv for a while now and with a few smaller roles in hollywood productions kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a careermaking performance

so what doesnt work as well essentially its the films third act i try to write my reviews without spoilers and i will here but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it its an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally also chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory given that theres been nothing to justify that save some talk about judo lessons

provided youre not anticipating horror in the traditional sense get out is a smart genre mingling effort not perfect but certainly not bad for a debut film",negative,2
237,237," like everyone else who saw this movie i was really surprised by jordan peeles directorial debut it had the perfect balance of tension and comedy that i havent seen in a while turning the premise of guess whos coming to dinner into an absolute nightmare unpredictable intense and hilarious with a terrific character arc performed fantastically by daniel kaluuya if youre the one person who hasnt seen this yet go check it out its good

239,239," ill make this brief as others have already made excellent points regarding the enormous amount of undeserved hype surrounding this film in summary:

 anyone who tells you that there is a twist ending is lying to you twenty minutes into the film it becomes apparent exactly where this is goingwith zero surprises

 each and every bit of comedy in the film falls flat which should tell you something about a director who supposedly makes his living writing sketchcomedy

 this film is completely devoid of nuance a comment that tyler perry himself has said about his own films in interviews

in closing the most disappointing aspect of this film is that there isnt much here to discuss just a bunch raciallycharged stock thrillertropes with a lifetime movie level plot much like ranchero music this is art for the dumb

a likable but not overacting or bland character in a new environment that will keep everyone still guessing will end up in a situation in which the viewer will rapidly realize what the sunken place is without losing all credibility

one creepy party and one revelation later the viewer will finally know what genre and what kind of movie we are watching a movie that reinvents creepy movies with the only small flaw being that after the twist things go too fast everything else acting characters surroundings works perfect

257,257," get out is billed as a horror film but  no spoilers in this review  its really more of a mysterytense thriller its shot really well and looks great nice effort from firsttime director peele with some smart use of the alabama location and a good score the premise is purposefully cryptic: africanamerican man visits his caucasian girlfriends mysterious family estate chris kaluuya is meeting rose williams parents  missy keener  dean whitford  for the first time and they welcome him with open arms even if the servants seem off

its not all about race but it is a key aspect of the film and handled quite well the two leads easily carry the film both having some great scenes however the best bits are probably whenever chris friend rod howery is on screen being hilarious and boisterous even though often by phone the humour and some slow bits do well to make the surprises seem even more shocking

258,258," best picture nominee:

ive seen get out twice now once with a group of friends way after it released on bluray and the second time in theaters during the oscars  best picture festival and both times i have loved this film

get out strikes this perfect balance of being a comedy and a horror film while simultaneously being social commentary about racism

the political message works really well here but its not the only thing going for it which can often times be the case for films that push a strong political agenda

the entire cast did so well that i was scared for chris and genuinely creeped out by the entire armitage family the setup is near perfect building up the appropriate amount of suspense that we needed for the later half of the film with the ending keeping me on the edge of my seat literally until the very last scene

im glad that get out won best screenplay and if it had won best picture i wouldnt have complained at all if you havent seen it yet go give it a watch",positive,7

directorwriter jordan peele has created a superb thriller that easily reminds one of the brilliant stepford wives  the tension slowly builds with the viewer identifying with chris the strange events seem harmless at first but there are too many coincidences to dismiss once the pieces come together its easy to see why the film was given its title

get out is not without its comical moments especially stupid comments from wellmeaning good white liberals which peak at a massive gardenpartyfromhell as a modern psychological horrorthriller with an unique perspective on racism its easy to see why get out has earned so much recognition during the current awards season it does borrow heavily from the stepford wives but clearly adds its own special creative spin on the people here sure are weird atmosphere  dbamateurcritic",positive,8
260,260," i am not a fan of horror genre i dont enjoy being scared and i am so glad it didnt stop me from seeing get out its not the kind of horror that makes you afraid of the dark or of showers or whatever innocent inanimate objects the horror is in the meaning the movie takes common casual racism and whatifs it to a whole other level plausibility of the horrific things that happen or lack thereof that can be an undoing of a movie like this for me is irrelevant here its the symbolism that matters and this symbolism is very subtle never in your face the film delivers a message yet never appears to be trying to say something

the lead and supporting actors are all great but i want to give special kudos to marcus henderson walter betty gabriel georgina and laketh stanfeld andre logan king they had the hardest jobs and they were fantastic the story flows smoothly there is never a false moment that could throw you out of the movies hypnotic grip i thought chriss mothers death was a bit overexploited but that is such a small complaint i wouldnt even count it as one the film is nothing short of shockingly brilliant",positive,7

264,264," this film manages to encapsulate quite a few themes we have here a psychological thrillerhorror which has themes on race and standing

the film begins with our lead a young black man who is to visit the white family of his well to do girlfriend as you are to find out not all is at it seems

i dont wish to say too much more on the story as it will easily give too much away the film can be quite derivative and as you watch it there are various films you can clearly see which influenced it

however that doesnt take away from the gist of what is here there are racial themes that will make you ponder on it all way after youve watched it which is what this is all about it make it interesting but it doesnt shove any political agendas down your throat

the acting is great with some recognisable cult film actors present special mention must go to lilrel howery who provides some comedy and tension relief in an otherwise very dark but often darkly humorous movie

265,265," an unheralded cash cow in its domestic revenue and also a succ√®s destime usa black comedian jordan peeles directorial debut get out rides on the coattail of the racial powder keg in the current usa soil conjures up a wellconceived conspiracy theory married with an aroused scenario taking the leaf from the timetested suburbia genre book a close cousin is ira levins the stepford wifes and enlivens its central story with robust horror tropes pulsating in a bracing beat

our virile hero is chris washington kaluuya a black photographer who is going to meet his white girlfriend rose armitages williams family for the first time what chris encounters is not the hostile racism usually presides within uncouth hillbillies or religiouspoisoned happy clappies instead in this closeknit wasp community what lurks around is something much more sinister and beyond ones wildest imagination the overt clue is the aberrant behaviors of the black servants living with the armitages: the housekeeper georgina gabriel and groundskeeper walter henderson at first glance peele seems to dangle viewers with a more conventional reference of slavery but correlating with the films unsettling prologue of abducting a black man andrew hayworth stanfield in the same neighborhood a sober mind suggests that we cannot take the situation for granted certainly something is wrong with the black people on the lot they are not themselves but the voodoo in the mix hits more on the mark of deeprooted illusion of immortality than the ostensible white supremacy there is a nuanced overtone even eulogizing black races vitality as the perfect human specimen meanwhile the main trope vouchsafes what lies beneath is the turpitude of extreme selfishness which deprives others of their identity brain for ones own sake a metaphor of powerabusing from those privileged few which is part and parcel of the films runaway success viewers cannot help but paralleling it with the current political affairs in the trump era  life can be a sick joke

artistically speaking peele rounds up a coherent albeit improbable story arc within its suburbia milieu an estate is quietly ensconced with quaint americana a retro luster contradicts the young couples modernist urbanity from that symbolic deerintheheadlight accident to the parapsychic hypnosis to a superbly and literally devised sunken place evoking the murky otherworldliness in jonathan glazers under the skin  until the mandatory but still engrossing bailingout killing spree get out treads circumspectly through the familiar ground without overdosing in the wantonness of its cock and bull story

credits should fairly given to a capable cast daniel kaluuya makes for a straightup hero with gaping intensity and allison williams capitalizes in roses aboutface veracity to a bonechilling effect lilrel howery as chris best friend a tsa officer stands out as the comic foil and a mouthpiece of inappropriate oneliners and an openly hearty bradley whitford a beguilingly frosty catherine keener and a delirious caleb landry jones rounds out an unsettling dysfunctional family last but not the least betty gabriel arguably leaves the most bizarre impression perfectly in line with the thematic outofbody creepiness

for all its hype and buzz get out benefits greatly from its timing and presentday context plus a genuinely appealing wheeze of identityswapping a miraclemaker borne out of an aboveaverage commodity that no one should begrudge for its success because it excels as a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting which is dishearteningly wanting in most wideopening theatrical staples especially at a dejected time like this",positive,9

control is a key theme throughout which gets transferred regularly this keeps things engaging and shows how easy it is for sides to change the plot is anything but heart felt and is certainly sinister enough to warrant the horror genre all parts seem played well by the cast and the movie doesnt scrimp on effects or acting surrounding scene quality

perhaps its appeal is how real it seems both emotionally and through strong acting  scenes eliminate the need for gimmicks and gremlins

thankfully i did come here and read some of the spoiler alert trivia it revealed a few things that i would have missed obviously this is a film worth talking about with others seeing again rethinking etc on the other hand i felt the name was very poorly chosen right from the first time i saw it advertised i just about overlooked it as the name combined with the genre suggested that it wasnt probably the kind of film that would interest me im so glad that i decided to check it out i suspect different people will have very different reactions to it it touches on some serious points strikes unexpected nerves and has some very unpredictable scenes

i never was a big fan of horror movies but as time goes by i keep enjoying them more and more maybe before i just watched the pretty bad ones i didnt know the cast but i did know jordan peele  however not as a director my god how great is he excellent directing skills throughout the whole runtime: amazing camerawork some cool long takes efficient jumpscares with the adequate loud and brief background sounds but his major achievement is definitely the screenplay thoughtprovoking disturbing and it handles racism and any preconceptions in a way that by the end floored me great concept executed seamlessly

the unknown cast to me at least is just an awesome surprise everyone shines in this brilliant movie and elevate it to a super captivating story that already has a fantastic mystery and intrigue surrounding it daniel kaluuya is unbelievably amazing all of the actors portraying the armitages family and housekeepers are equally spectacular and lilrel howery rod williams is amazing as the comic relief guy

the tone switches a lot throughout the film peele goes from comedy to horror from drama to thriller in an instant but its so well directed that its fluidity is near perfection also the editing is flawless to my knowledge and the way he depicted and explored every preconception and racist stereotype is really brilliant

a movie definitely worth watching at least twice it has a huge replay value and i already see it as a horror classic

does it have flaws unfortunately it does  in the smallest details but it does watching a second time i couldnt help to notice that some scenes are just weird with no real meaning behind it roses backstory is my main and only issue with the screenplay but i really cant get more indepth than this unless i spoil it for you which i wont i can just say that theres a plot point that i still struggle to acceptunderstand

there are also some exposition scenes that could have been handled differently and the pacing dragged a little bit in the second act but it didnt affect me that much since the writing is so great that it almost passed by without me really noticing

get out is probably the most underrated movie in portugal so far and im thrilled that i was able to catch it and watch it twice jordan peele proves that his directing skills are something extraordinary his screenplay is pure brilliance and his cast is unquestionably incredible starting on the protagonist daniel kaluuya to lilrel howery the man behind the comedy bits in the film a very important and thoughtprovoking movie with social preconceptions on other races explored to the tiniest detail that only fails to deliver a precise backstory to rose and it has some really minor issues with its second acts pacing and exposition scenes",positive,8
273,273, this has been the one film that has come out this year that i missed in the cinema but i have now see get out and i really enjoyed this film the premise of the film sees a young black man go and meet his white girlfriends family he seems to notice that something weird might be going on daniel kaluuya is a new actor to me and he plays the lead in this film and he is fantastic in this film you are rooting for his character so much throughout this film as you are really watching this film through his eyes he is very likable in the film that makes him a great character allison williams is his girlfriend in this film and she is good in this film they have very good chemistry together and you are behind there relationship succeeding lilrel howery plays his friend in this film and he is hilarious in this film his dialogue is great throughout the whole film and is really funny in the film the entire cast does a great job with the roles they are given and all the characters are interesting to watch the story is pretty fascinating as you see this guy try and get used to his new surroundings while trying to work out was is actually wrong however even though entertaining i felt the end of this film to be a bit rushed and i could have done with an extra  or  minutes of details the script is great the blend of humour and drama is really well handled and makes this more unique then expected the style of the film has so much great tension that truly sucks you in to follow and try and work out what is going on but i wasnt a huge fan of some of the more trippy off the walls scenes that took me out of the serious nature of this film overall this is a great film with so much great social commentary and should definitely be seen,positive,8
274,274," a movie that truly keep you on the edge of your seat i cant remember the last time a thriller movie got me emotionally exhausted  even the comedy scenes were much needed in this movie  especially with very intense non violent scenes the conversations alone were pretty intense unlike most mystery movies the ending is not disappointing nor over the top saying anything else will probably ruin the movie

275,275," get out is the directorial debut from comic jordan peele and tells the story of chris an african american man meeting his white girlfriends parents for the first time at their secluded home in the woods with all the praise surrounding get out i tried to go in with an open mind not letting the hype overwhelm for what could be an ok film however after seeing it the praise its well deserved this is a meticulous wellcrafted film that offers both frights and moments of laughter i was thoroughly impressed by how well made this film was the score and cinematography is both haunting and dreamlike giving the viewer an unsettling experience the story in get out is well realized and the trailer doesnt do enough justice this isnt a white vs black film but rather a social commentary on marginalization that uses the current events in our world as a springboard to get its ideas across there were themesmetaphors throughout the film that i didnt realize were connected until the movie was over this is far more than your average scary movie though you can treat it like a good ole popcorn flick the film has enough depth to keep the most sharpeyed viewer thinking afterwards

with that aside get out is an almost perfect example of a horrorcomedy mix the use of lilrel howery as the comic relief was excellent his moments were scattered throughout the film but they never felt out of place and he was actually genuinely funny this film felt like an old episode of goosebumps or a live action version of the board game clue due to the mystery the protagonist faces as he is discovering what is going so is the audience and though i was able to piece together what was happening early on i was still enthralled with what was going on due to the excellent writing and performances most of the actors and actresses in this film were unknown to me but all of them played their roles convincingly well particularly caleb landry jones who had a riveting scene that takes place at a dinner table which really got under my skin

overall this is a well crafted film that had me on the edge of seat jordan peele proves that he is not just a funny guy but should be taken seriously as writer and director i thoroughly enjoyed my time with get out and do highly recommend it i see myself rewatching this film quite a few times especially around the halloween season as it just has a fall vibe to it this really is one of my favourite movies ive seen so far this year so for that reason im giving get out an ",positive,8
276,276," several things to like about this one  how it approached a sensitive subject was both directly honest and at times unexpectedly by viewer but of course by design funny  actors well chosen and their performances almost too real to the point of weird scary you just dont know what secretly lurks behind those smiles  you know something is not quite right and the writerdirector did a nice job of building into hownotrightitwas  rod our tsa agent and friend to chris our lead protagonist was a highlight bonus offering a humorous perspective a role where usually the confidant ends up being either clueless incompetent or dead  check out his endoffilm worldly advices sp to chris in special features  i preferred the ending that our director chose vs the alternate ending as it was consistent with chriss intelligence and personality

277,277," get out follows a young black man as he goes to visit his white girlfriends parents from there weirder and weirder things begin to take place

to start the acting is pretty solid daniel kaluuya as the leading character paints himself as something of the modern something yearold hes relatable hes mostly interesting hes got his flaws and hes got his perks and hes a photographer gotta appeal to the hipster crowd too in all seriousness his character is very realistically played but even more so when he needs to hit an emotional high note this guy nails it starring alongside him is allison williams whom i believe said that this was her first movie seeing her on screen thats not something youd think shes so subtle and so well played even if she is a little dull from time to time you can tell thats part of her character thats what shes going for and it actually works really well the performances of the two parents catherine keener and bradley whitford are great as well im going to sound like a broken record here but again subtlety they got it in a film of overwhelming mystery the subtlety here plays a key role and works fantastically from start to finish

but what are good actors without a good screenplay the writing is quite good while a few lines came off as forced or awkward the vast majority of it works very well and the way the story progresses is engaging and very mysterious it never really hints at what the end goal may be and yet it makes sense when its finally revealed theres no eureka moment when the twist is revealed yet that may be the very reason it worked so well because once again subtlety

probably the biggest star of this film is jordan peele the director its hard to believe that this is the first time hes made a full length film his ability to direct is fantastic the way its shot is that of a professional and i look forward to seeing more of his filmmaking career in the near future

most horror movies feature generic music cues and sharp loud sound effects to keep the viewer awake through its entirely boring scare tactics and while get out does use those same sound effects they are woven into actual music that is quite good and i get the feeling that the music was partially used to satire typical horror movies considering how unique this one is compared to others and while it may come off of as generic or lazy to cue the creepy music when creepy stuff happens the music is still good and upon a second watch actually justified

while i enjoyed get out for the most part both times i saw it thats probably my biggest problem with it the first time i saw it i didnt care at all the build up seemed to be going nowhere and it was all just so weird however when the twist ending rolled around i suddenly understood and enjoyed it much more upon a rewatch i was able to pick up on the things i missed along with some unexpected comedic foreshadowing and while some of the comedy did work some of it didnt unlike the trailer made it seem the movie is hardly a satire on modern horror or even a comedy to begin with its very much a mystery so dont go into it expecting to laugh

overall i really enjoyed get out the acting writing and story are good and the soundtrack is effectively used its a subtle mystery that hits more high notes than low ones its one that i can certainly see myself returning to time and time again to see and pick up on new things in the end id definitely recommend it but moreover id recommend seeing it more than once",positive,8
279,279," get out :

satirical horror on most controversial issue of americajordan peeledebutante director chose such sensitive and rare subject and moulded it into a great film which got great critical and commercial success which is completely rare for a horror filmi always look out for non typical horror films which has something new in itso how is the movie

plot:

chris daniel kaluuya and his girlfriend rose uyir piriyum valiyai go upstate to visit her parents for the weekend at first chris reads the familys overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughters interracial relationship but as the weekend progresses a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined

plus points:

story screenplay and direction: jordan peele really deserves an applause for making such a dare attemptmovies on racism issues are not new in hollwyood but jordan peele achieved an unthinkable featwithout using typical jump scares peele utilizing a queasy atmosphere of dread and a terrifically choreographed escalation of suspense and crowdpleasing thrills

cinematography: toby olivers terrific cinematography successfully brought the necessary eerie feel to the moviethe sunken placean area at which chris goes in hypnotized phase is a stunning shot

bgm: newcomer michael abelss bgm is pitch perfect as it even gives a subtle hint of mocking other horrors background scores

performances: daniel kaluuya who impresses with a charismatic performance that should ultimately be seen as his breakout leading role constantly making you question anything and everything that is going on are allison williams bradley whitford and catherine keener who use their innate affability to make you question every move they make deserving of special attention though is lil rel howery who plays chris best friend and contact in the outside world and steals every single scene hes in

soget out is a much needed refreshing breeze for a new age of horror filmmost innovative horror since it follows

280,280," i recently watched this movie again with my girlfriend who hasnt seen it and i have to retract my original opinion i think i was in a bad mood when i first saw it in theatres and blasted it but now seeing it for the second time its a very original intense thriller turned horror by the end my only big knock on this movie is that within the first  mins or so i already had figured out what was happening not to the extent that it goes to but it was predictable its worth a watch

281,281," this movie is unexpected and unpredictable  think twighlight zone alfred hitchcock my mother the serial killer stepford wives the lottery  put them all in a blender with great actors and spooky music and it comes close to describing this film jordan peele slices through political correctness like a neurosurgeon you end up hating the characters you liked and liking the tsa nothing ends up the way you expect heading in one direction you think you have it figured out and all of a sudden you take a proverbial left turn off a cliff with a stupid brother playing banjo and things are not what they seem pacing timing cinematography lighting music all combine to keep things tight and focused funny moments but this isnt a comedy you will leave the movie theater thinking more deeply and seeing more clearly and wanting to see the movie again but you may never drink a cup of tea again

287,287," the warning comes early on in get out comedian jordan peeles deliciously unsettling horror and directorial debut as successful new york photographer chris daniel kaluuya phones his best friend rod a hilarious lilrel howery to break the news that he is to meet his white girlfriends middleclass parents at their countryside home rod immediately voices his concerns he is adamant that there is bound to be some weird sexslave st going down but chris laughs it off with no idea with what is in store for him in years to come i have no doubt that get out will be a key case study in trying to understand the racial minefield that is modern america while many have convinced themselves that such medieval attitudes are now behind them its quite clear that tensions are as high as ever in the backlivesmatter postobama world we live in

on their journey chris and his girlfriend rose allison williams hit a deer when being questioned by the police the white officer cant resist giving chris a hard time even though he wasnt the one driving he receives a tellingoff from rose but the tone is set chris shrugs it off because he is no doubt used to it upon arriving at the impressive home of the potentially future inlaws father and neurosurgeon dean bradley whitford insists they are huggers and appears to embrace chris he nonetheless lets slip opinions about wiping out the race of pesky deer who roam their land and voices his frustration at his own father missing out on the olympic games due to jesse owens but again this is nothing chris hasnt seen before from middleclass white obamavoters roses mother missy catherine keener is more steely but is a trained hypnotist and offers to help chris rid himself of his nicotine addiction so far so uncomfortable but things soon get seriously weird

for such apparently raciallyblind liberals their household staff are all black not only that but they are like deadeyed robots all smiles and pleasantries masking pleading and inner turmoil when chris tries to bond with groundskeeper and fellow brother walter marcus henderson the conversation is awkward and stiff and maid georgina the brilliant betty gabriel seems to do little during her off hours but stare at herself in the mirror at a gathering at their home the only black face in the large crowd seems unnervingly familiar but he is dressed up like a trophy pet by his fat much older white wife when missy finally gets chris to sit down for a session and open up about the death of his mother his worst fears are truly realised taking inspiration from of all films being john malkovich which also starred keener peele directs these moments with the eye of a horror maestro proving to be truly uncomfortable claustrophobic viewing

get out wears its heart on its sleeve with an almost complete disregard for subtlety however this works in the films favour its hugely entertaining and frequently very funny so it will appeal to just about any audience reaching more people in the process wordofmouth has already gotten around so the message is clearly resonating its sharp and unique in a way that modern horror movies rarely are and in no way feels like an elongated sketch from the key and peele tv show although ive seen relatively little of his work outside of sketches on youtube and his appearance with keegan michael key in season  of fargo there is nothing in his previous output to suggest he was capable of crafting such an intelligent and engaging horror movie satirically savvy and edgy get out is also creepy and thoughtful proving that a black man alone in the white suburbs is just as terrifying as a pretty white girl lost in the woods",positive,8
288,288, jordan peeles screen writingdirectorial debut is quite the leap exchanging the comedic chops one might expect for a potent blend of social commentary suspense and horror peele shows us a creepy upperclass suburban atmosphere host to a mixedrace couples meet the parents moment with a thick permeating air of uncertainty and alarm everyone seems overly accepting of chris hometown girl roses new black boyfriend but theres a look to their gaze that might imply something else the towns darkskinned residents however are less reserved they behave like marionettes stepford wives with an unnervingly wide smile: stiff oddlydressed and thoroughly disconcerting in posture and prose at first glance i worried that the metaphors peele was searching for would be too onthenose and blunt but his well paced mutilayered story soon brushes those concerns away the analogies remain but theyre nuanced and subtle effective players in a larger tapestry the greater story is twisting and unpredictable a mystery that efficiently mixes legitimate worries with tensionbreaking laughs and personal connections to throw us off the scent we dont know whos in on the scheme or what that scheme might be until the very end and for too long chris is afraid to point fingers lest he offend balancing social niceties with the increasing terror makes a great vehicle for this genre and the primandproper atmosphere only makes the occasional weird offhand remark or personal tick stick out that much more an excellent smallscale nailbiter its richly crafted and sharp with a sensitive finger right on the cultural pulse well worth the hype,positive,9
289,289," with a title as get out i was expecting a bloody horror movie but it isnt that kind of movie i would not call it a real horror movie though more a mystery thriller the mystery part is clearly the best part of the movie and luckily for us the mystery last almost the entire movie it all starts nicely but the more you get into the movie the more it gets creepy theres clearly something bad going on but they dont reveal everything at once and thats a real positive thing in this movie the suspense building is slow but once youre into it you wont get out of it daniel kaluuya plays the major character and he did a great job the rest of the cast was also good and they all contribute to make this movie better than the rest in this genre to me the best part of the movie is the middle of the movie where you wonder what the hell is happening one of the better movies in this genre that i saw this year

290,290," people are way overthinking this movie its not a socialpolitical satire its not racist yes it does make fun of white racist stereotypes of black people but nobody in their right mind would think the writerdirector actually thinks most white people think like the mad scientists in this film do this is a basic thriller a piece of oldfashioned moviemaking it is inspired by the classic the stepford wives which did something similar with sexism as this film does with racism

the plot involves a young black man who is taken by his girlfriend to visit her parents for the weekend the family has black servants who act weird although the plot unfolds in a somewhat predictable way the movie is elevated by intriguing parallels that involve the main characters childhood trauma the mom is a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis and being a hypnotherapist myself i can say that although these scenes exaggerate the power of hypnosis they dont exaggerate it by much

there are a few surprises but what i liked best about this movie is the strange recurring motif that involves the main characters trauma we see his weakness but also his strength that made this film a cut above standard horrorthriller movies

by the way this movie is not very violent its about average for a suspense movie if you want a slasher movie with a lot of blood and gore this isnt it its a thinking persons movie",positive,9
291,291," get out is a combination of a comedy and a horror but it certainly isnt your average horrorcomedy hybrid it is one that makes a daunting achievement of not only evenly balancing laughs with a grim tone but providing a fascinatingly unique examination on racism an issue that is overwhelmingly relative in our society today there are gutbusting laughs there are some dark moments and are even some scenes of gore but above these components is an intelligent yet bizarre allegory of the africanamerican community falling victim to racial prejudice among a society where racism has run rampant the mastermind behind this treat is jordan peele the sketch comedic star fresh from comedy centrals key and peele and taking the seat in his directorial debut with a blend of vulgar humor and gags centered on racial stereotypes peeles comedic flair definitely bleeds through this film focuses on chris washington played by daniel kaluuya a twentysomething year old african american man who sets out to spend the weekend with his caucasian girlfriend rose armitage played by allison williams at her parents house upon meeting her parents played by bradley whitford and catherine keener for the first time chris quickly begins to witness some strange behavior among the family including relatives and their house maid georgina played by betty gabriel who happens to africanamerican this leads to one major conclusion: something is not about this family

it is significantly rare that directors successfully pull off an congruent balance of outrageous laughter and spinechilling scares let alone splicing smart social commentary on racial prejudice jordan peele manages to hit that note in nearly every way possible to the point where there is never a dull moment the film spends the first half showcasing the paranoia of the lead characters uncomfortable situation including calm interactions with his girlfriends family that quickly morph into awkward circumstances throughout the time peele does a tremendous job at breathing suspense into the atmosphere that viewers feeling offkilter and questioning what on earth is happening around the lead character and what the characters are thinking about the lead character being colored skin and dating a white female in turn of satirizing the subject matter the film does so by providing witty social commentary about the africanamerican stereotypes rather than being going the obvious route by preaching about racial bigotry along the way there is more than a handful of laughs to be offered most of which come from the lead characters best friend played by lilrel howery who spends most of the time away from the chaos it is not until the final halfhour however when the film escalates into a gory and unnerving fiasco challenging viewers expectations upon every turn while the ending does not the strike a chord in the surprise department peele never fails to defy against uniformity nor does slap viewers in the face with his political message

get out is an entertaining audacious and surprisingly brainy horrorcomedy that not only showcases jordan peeles unexpected directorial talent but opens the door to an outrageous fun yet bizarre good time marking this film as cinematic gold for both the comedy and horror genre may be saying a lot at the same time it wouldnt be too unreasonable especially as no hollywood director has a made a more daring comedic endeavor such a long time",positive,9
293,293," its a kind of horror movie i have never seen before  this an awesome cast specially daniel he has a special performance  at the beginning you wont understand anything that is normal thing and you wont expect what will happen but im sure you will surprised  it has many perfect symbols reflected at the end  and it has a light comedy jokes

i am not going to give anything away all i have to say is that the movie keeps you engaged right the way through as a viewer you know that something is not right but you cant out your finger on it and for me when the secret was finally revealed it certainly was not what i was thinking

in terms of time the movie is just the right length thats one of the reasons why the movie works so well from an acting front there is no one standout actor but ideal for the characters they play

so go right ahead watch the movie and prepare to get out

298,298," i have to be honest with you: when i first saw how good approval this movie had got i immediately thought that must be due to both actor and producer being black i was wrong get out is one the best horror movies in the last decade standing alongside with it follows and the babadook who have got over eighty metascore rating as well which is very rare for a horror movie to have

so we are following an interracial couple visiting her rich white parents chris her boyfriend is a photographer and a very downtoearth guy who may feel well a bit awkward surrounded by a bunch of rich white people from the moment they arrive things look kinda shady nothing in particular prone to much suspect but that gut feeling tells you that this family least said might not be the healthiest one creating this quaint ambient is what get out does the best not only that but jordan peele even managed to fully utilize this mystery elements by creating few very eerie and unpredictable plot twists

story itself isnt much of a big deal but does what is supposed to do: it creeps slowly and bursts formidably hence get out is not fast paced like green room but rather makes you think about what is going on here different relationship which characters form with each other are worth noticing too it is truly formidable to have people who you trust turn their back on you in most terrible way chris is experiencing snippets of this all the time but may as well think he is the problem just wait till you see the grand finale with this aspect

it is always dangerous to combine serious horrormysterythriller with humor because it might create a conflict between these two contrary sides get out breaks the monotony of tension by introducing a character who doesnt occupy much time not undermines basic genre and manages to somehow reset the atmosphere by breaking it with humor the mystery side then takes the lead and begins to glue the atmosphere back together this time even stronger until everything bursts due to pressure

weve seen some basic mechanism which peele utilized so let me immediately conclude get out is a serious candidate for the best horror movie of the last decade or so all the elements stick together because there is a strong atmosphere which serves as a glue it is scary and funny get out of here and see it",positive,8

this movie really have a strong script good actors and the net result is amazing

302,302," a near master class in tonal balance every scene can be viewed through a lens of either horror or comedy and it works this is truly exceptional a great reactionary performance from daniel kaluuya full of responsive eye twitches and halfsmirks that speak volumes

the social satire cuts deep especially in its revelation of a white liberal racism outside the stereotypical redneck variety but the film relents a bit in the final act same goes for the horror elements the finale is a bit of a stretch even if it is fittingly cathartic and the movie doesnt reach for the extreme hard enough to justify its more out there elements behold the coagula it kind of falls awkwardly in the middle a half measure

305,305," i can now see why this psychological horror is so mindbending after catching this movie i have to say that this is a thrill ride that continuously toyed with my perspective up until the terrible truth is unveiled midway into the film

chris washington daniel kaluuya a black man with a hobby in photography has a white girlfriend named rose that live happily together in the city when she then decides to finally introduce him to her parents in her hometown outside the city they seem to welcome him in open arms however the townsfolk begin to show signs of odd behavior whenever chris so much as approaches any of them or if he even speaks his mind in conversations chris becomes increasingly paranoid as he uncovers more to the town than meets the eye

for comedian jordan peeles directorial debut in a horror film and his pairing with paranormal activity producer jason blum this is something that required more thought as the story began to play out i honestly attempted to comprehend the motives of each character but as i started deducing their reasons it grows unsettling each time instead of racism being used as a plot device it seems this is a bizarre twist on that subject matter by making the residence not racist yet they add insult to injury in their true nature by giving off a form of liberal ignorance there are moments in the film that were pretty laughable to ease the tension done by the leading mans best friend tsa officer rod played by comic lil rel howery and i say this doesnt ruin the ride more like only gives depth into what his character knows whats best for himself and his friend in the end this isnt a movie made for cheap jumps or thrills instead it kept the gears in my mind constantly turning and my curiosity growing with how the horror conventions were approached differently here its certainly interesting",positive,9
309,309," you could predict the quality ‚Äì or at least freshness ‚Äì from the trailers but nothing will quite prepare you for this joyride which is a contender for the best horror movie of recent times and crafty enough to satisfy also those who dont really care about horror movies such as me

brother daniel kaluuya dating a white girl allison williams is dragged to her family estate for the weekend but something is off from the very start of the journey and it gets stranger by the minute

theres a variety of cool cats in smaller supporting roles and you will probably not know them by name but i will list them anyway: bradley whitford and catherine keener as the mother and father caleb landry jones as the brother betty gabriel as the house maid lilrel howery as one of the funniest cases of black guy acting like hollywood comedy black guy i can remember

imdb claims he is a rising standup comedy star and hes surely an instant crowdpleaser here you will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen

but back to the movie at hand ¬Ñget out is an effective horror piece but directorscreenwriter jordan peeles ambitions are decidedly wider than that and he can meet the high standards that he has set

if i have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment then i would say that peele proves to be a master storyteller

theres a surprising diversity and depth to material it can be followed as social commentary what its like to be different how covertly racist the modern society can be classic horror story adventurer braving the lands unknown and a crafty catandmouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every chess piece is moved and how the others react

in addition theres an unexpected comic relief going on mainly acted out by lilrey howrey as mentioned above and last but not least the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesnt have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements

peele actually uses some of those too but in a way that doesnt feel exploitative these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels

if i may nitpick a little the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward andor unpleasant situations like in black version of ¬Ñcurb your enthusiasm or something this onenoteperformance by kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the actionfilled final act

but all in all the chosen approach is understandable because ¬Ñget out is only  minutes long and has a lot happening and to credit the cast one more time everybodys offering a topquality work even the people in smallest roles

considering how much their faces are shown upclose its no mean feat id even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times

there are also some pacing issues mostly during the end which would be more hardhitting if played out faster especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle

of course that would require attentive watching and not checking your phone all the time as many youngsters do these days also horror fans would probably like to see more gore but this is not a problem in itself so the movies not near perfect but what is eh

¬Ñget out is that rare kind of horror movie that really deserves some majorass awards or nominations maybe oscar noms for original screenplay directing and several possible picks from supporting cast betty gabriel bradley whitford lilrel howery if i can pick three

if you liked this little gem that deserves to be called born classic then you will be pleased to know that its been already popular in cinemas it only cost  million usd and has already brought  mil from the us box office alone

get out is the best movie of  ive seen yet and i have seen ten get off your ass and run towards the cinemas",positive,10
310,310," the opening scene of get out  release  min shows a black guy being abducted and thrown into the back of a car as he was talking at night in an unspecified suburb we have no clue what is going on after the opening title we get to know rose and chris an interracial couple  they are getting ready for a weekend visit to roses parents who have no idea that chris is africanamerican but rose insists all will be fine on the drive up when their car is hit by a deer the cop asks chris for identification even though he wasnt driving rose takes offense at the seeming racial profiling finally rose and chris arrive at her parents place a suburban mcmansion and receive a warm welcome at this point we are  min into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out

couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from actorwriterproducerdirector jordan peele making his directorial debut peele best known for comedy goes into a vastly different direction presenting a clever and original horror story for the thinking person if you are expecting a slasher horror movie the likes of which are all too common these days in the horror genre you will be disappointed or relieved depending on your viewpoint instead the story focuses on an increasingly discomforting situation where a black man gets introduced to a white family and circle of friends who wouldve voted for obama a third time if i had the chance british actor daniel kaluuya whom we most recently saw in the outstanding sicario is even better in this lead role playing the coolascucumber chris until things arent cool anymore mustnt say morebiting my tongue here but the big star even though he never appears on the screen is of course jordan peele who shows enormous promise in his directorial debut working on a for hollywood microscopic budget of a mere  million peele gives us an accomplished horror movie where less is more cant wait to see what peele will do next but whatever it is im all in

get out opened wide some weeks ago to immediate critical and commercial acclaim this movie may well become the biggest financial success as in: return on investment of the year rapidly approaching  mill at the box office in north america the sunday early evening screening where i saw this at here in cincinnati this weekend was packed and sold out to the very last seat quite unusual for a movie thats been playing already for weeks but the positive buzz and correlating wordofmouth surrounding this movie are absolutely merited even if youre not a fan of the horror film genre like me i encourage you to seek this out be it in the theater later on vod or eventually on dvdbluray get out is in every which way a winner",positive,9
312,312," get out is the director debut for jordan peele and he did a fantastic job this movie is suspenseful and well done the comedy landed well especially the character rod this is one of the rare new stand alone horror films where i remember most of the characters names i loved it its trippy and scary without the need of jump scares many times the scary part was its atmosphere this was well made and i look forward to the next few movies with the same crew in a few years

314,314," i came to imdb after watching get out and i was excited to see what everyone else thought of this fantastic movie

you can imagine my disappointment to find more than a fair share of cries of racism and the despicable repeated and ironically racist notion that if this movie had a white director it would not have received the same praise

the reality is that this movie is brilliant and horrifying absolutely unbelievable work for the firsttime director jordan peele i love horror films but ive become jaded and found it hard to feel anything resembling terror from anything released in the past few years

this movie is terrifying terrifying in a way that keeps you begging to know more even once the credits roll

315,315, the first two acts of get out  are fantastic creating a palpable sense of growing unease and mounting dread the film does come to somewhat of a halt as it approaches its final third with one scene too many spent away from our protagonist its fortunate then that the explosive finale brings the story to a satisfying conclusion all the tension culminates in a brutal final confrontation that isnt afraid to go dark finally releasing all that expertly built tension and becoming an incredibly crowdpleasing but still gruelling experience its a very smart and subversive film one that manages to plant the seeds for almost every aspect of its plot perfectly and tie the perspective of its protagonist into its narrative in an incredibly intrinsic way it satisfyingly subverts the tropes of the genre while still hitting all the beats required to make it recognisable to a wide audience on a second viewing it is easy to forget just how strange and unexpected the picture truly is it is honestly one of the most surprising pieces ive seen in some time with each twist somehow seeming wholly natural yet entirely out of left field the movie also has some incredible writing and several fully formed characters that are among the best of their kind special mention must be made of daniel kaluuya who deserves all the praise and awards coming his way as he delivers what is for me perhaps the best performance of the year the picture represents remarkable filmmaking in every sense and is definitely one of the absolute best horror films ive ever seen ,positive,8
316,316," the amiable daniel kaluuya gives an enjoyable breakthrough performance as chris washington a young black artist dating white girl rose armitage allison williams five months into the relationship and its time to meet her parents they live in a back of the beyond universe populated almost exclusively by whites along with a few black people who behave quite strangely chris will discover some nefarious doings by roses mom and pop catherine keener bradley whitford and these other members of the white elite will he be able to get out of this situation before its too late

overall the filmmaking debut for sketch comedian jordan peele is a respectable if not great effort to blend some commentary on racial relations with a tried and true formulaic hollywood thriller this viewer could point out the film that seems to have inspired peele the most but that would be along the lines of a spoiler while the film is technically well made and well paced and builds towards an appropriately visceral finale it is troubling in some ways its mystery is easy to figure out hell chris seemingly paranoid friend rod lilrel howery may actually be on to something and the characters are pretty black and white if youll pardon the expression undoubtedly the film is perfect at being manipulative with villains whose violent comeuppance is the ultimate catharsis

the cast provides most of the value williams is good as the girlfriend who at first tries to have you wondering is she or isnt she old pros like keener whitford stephen root and richard herd do as much as they can with cliched roles the lively and profane howery is quite amusing caleb landry jones dials up the seediness to  in his role as roses loutish brother jeremy

as this viewer said the scenario is likely to get the blood of some audience members boiling but it could have used a bit more restraint its certainly entertaining to a degree and clearly it did hit a nerve with the moviegoing public even garnering some oscar nominations

six out of ",positive,8
317,317," jordan peeles debut has changed the game a sharp visceral and at some points comedic look at modern racism in america is just what cinema needed

social thrillers now have standards set far higher than any predecessor due to outstanding performances by daniel kaluuya and allison williams and a captivating story line with a perfect plot twist

what prevents this thriller from reaching the heights of nolans is the unfortunate unrealistic concept of brain transfers which frustratingly holds back this film from becoming a masterpiece

despite that the symbols and motifs lift this film well beyond classic thrillers and has engraved itself in the history of cinema

319,319," the only thing id known before walking into get out aside from the hype is that it somehow mixes racial politics and horror and really that alone is enough to get the curiosity piqued but its the mechanics of the thing that makes it so entertaining the how

jordan peele kicks things off with a certain sense of foreboding that a potentially awkward meetingherparents getaway has sinister intent nothing is what it seems and that uncertainty makes the viewer uncomfortable in my case at least dread builds on itself until peele finally pulls out the rug with a classic horror twist from there its a solid thrill ride til the very end

i liked everything about this movie the excellent cast the sharp writing the tense subject matter even the comedic side character is ideal but i loved that i had no idea where all of this was going

its scary as hell and a lot of fun

",positive,7
320,320," multitalented jordan peele both write and directed this controversial thriller that is likely to win awards in many categories not only has he selected a superb cast but he also is willing to take the racial conflict where few have dared go  a story where the concept of being black in a white atmosphere changes from being an advantage a showcase for black culture to a nightmare of racism carried to the extreme

the film opens strangely with an incident on the street of an apparent kidnapping of a black young man lakeith stanfield jump some time later when chris daniel kaluuya a young black photographer visits rose allison williams his white girlfriends family estate he becomes ensnared in the more sinister real reason for the invitation the parents psychiatrist missy  catherine keener and neurosurgeon dean  bradley whitford are strange but apparently conspicuously nonracist at first chris reads the familys overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughters interracial relationship but as the weekend progresses a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he could have never imagined the manner in which the black help  walter marcus henderson and georgina betty gabriel  interact with chris is bizarre as is the presence of some of the guests at a party held in the estate at night where it leads must be seen  otherwise the mood and story are spoiled

unique story well written and directed and photographed and acted this is a fine film that makes many necessary observations",positive,9
321,321," this film could be categorized as a horror film or a satire it has elements of both although the golden globes nominating it in the comedymusical category is a stretch

much has already been said about the film by critics and in other imdb reviews a film like this is only as good as the performances and they are incredible the entire cast mustve realized what an original piece this is merging elements from home invasion movies like the purge with social comedies like guess whos coming to dinner if you are familiar with the careers of bradley whitford and catherine keener you will be knocked out by what they do in this film allison williams daughter of brian those cheekbones give that away is also downright surprising here

perhaps the golden globes placed this film in the comedymusical category since there were so many fine dramas to come out in  we can only be as lucky with movies next year",positive,10
322,322," in  jordan peele proved hes not a onetrick pony when it comes to his career when not playing all kinds of various characters on his comedy central series key  peele he lately has starred in mostly lowertiered comedy movies then came get out  universal and blumhouses terrifying psychological thriller that was written and directed by peele the film follows the story of a young couple who happen to be mixed race daniel kaluuya as chris and allison williams as rose who take a weekend trip to visit her parents estate in the country

whats expected about get out is the major emphasis on race as roses family and extended family is virtually entirely white and their two hired support staff georgina and walter betty gabriel and marcus henderson are black as chris begins to learn more about his girlfriends family as he spends more time with them he realizes things are not exactly what meets the eye while some films mishandle the issue of race relations get out is written in a way that seems fair and doesnt spend too much time on stereotypes but make no mistake  there is a lot more at play than race in this film

the themes of guilt and regret have a central role in get out including references to characters pasts especially with regard to chris and his upbringing what helps these feel authentic is the excellent character development and acting performances not only by newcomers kaluuya and williams but veteran actors bradley whitford and catherine keener are standouts as roses parents they are complicated individuals and things become clearer as the film progresses but they never lose their edge as we drift into the sunken place and then theres lilrel howery who portrays chris tsa agent friend rod williams rods character is definitely the films attempt at comic relief  and for the most part he delivers without making things seem too cheesy or out of place

the only issue with get out is the final third of the film which seems to follow a typical formula despite the adrenaline rush that results there are flashes of a seen it before feeling in some of the final moments even so this does not really take away from the overall effort

based on the runaway success of get out its likely jordan peele has a future in directing and writing rather than just offering up laughs",positive,9
323,323," get out directed by jordan peele is like no other film that i have ever seen not a conventional comedy nor a conventional horror movie  but rather a trenchant psychological thriller about blackwhite relations incorporating myth history and racial symbolism resulting in an intelligent profoundly moving fable get out opens with an abduction of an innocent young black man who is lost aimlessly searching for an address on a quiet suburban street in the dark of night  this one abbreviated cinematic moment encapsulates years of racial violence forecasting what lies ahead for the viewer

we witness a young couple who appear to be disarmingly happy  a young african american man chris washington an excellent daniel kaluuya and his white girlfriend rose armitage a lovely allison williams packing in preparation for a visit to her parents home in the suburbs once they are in the car leaving the city they allegorically cross a color line and the mystery and tension mounts with baleful incidents that augur a grim future

when they arrive at their destination we observe in the behavior towards chris a cool veneer that is draped over each character like a shroud of duplicity particular roses liberal parents the wonderful catherine keener as her mother missy along with a groups of friends who are invited to an annual lawn party each character is satirically delineated with a familiarity that betrays their inner bigotry get out is so biting that the ensuing marks claw deeply under our skins

jordan peele formerly of key and peele in his directorial debut makes memorable use of his powerful comedic skill but this time we do not laugh with joy but we drown in the despair of a modernday allegory of stereotypical attitudes and conspiratorial stratagems towards afroamericans that are as original and devastating as a sciencefiction tale",positive,8
325,325," ive seen mixed reviews about this movie some people loved it while others consider it to display an extreme standpoint of systematic racism to me its a wellmade horror movie with subtle comedic moments the perspective although exaggerated and unrealistic is fresh and unique its a break from typical horror movies and there are great symbolic references through the visuals dialogue and soundtrack there is great depth to the scenes and i realized this after reading the imdb trivia section avoid it if you havent watched the movie yet the plot was quite predictable but i was impressed by the way it was executed the dialogue contains great meaning and provides us an insight into the stereotypes that human beings have to live with everyday and lastly it was refreshing to see the black guy actually surviving till the end of a horror movie

344,344," star rating:  saturday night  friday night  friday morning  sunday night  monday morning

chris washington daniel kaluuya and rose armitage allison williams are a mixed race couple who are travelling to meet roses parents missy catherine keener and dean bradley whitford a retired neurosurgeon for the weekend while they seem fairly nice chris cant help but pick up loads of subtle little knocks at his african american heritage most notably learning deans grandfather was robbed of his dream at the  olympics by jesse owens one night missy puts chris under a teacup induced hypnotic trance and from there he finds himself plunged into a series of increasingly twisted events from which he ends up battling for survival

the horror genre is in a pretty desperate state of affairs at the moment certainly not a patch on its heyday twentythirty years ago when theyre not remaking old classics theyre just making films that rely on cheap jump scares in place of anything that really gets under your skin and so its a really nice surprise when something like get out comes along which gives you faith that theres still life in the old dog yet first time director jordan peele gets back to basics with what traditionally made the genre so great in a film thats also from the producers of such hits as insidious and the gift

peele understands that a creepy air of mystery and a foreboding sense of the unknown are far more effective tools than cheap shocks and gore and what works in get outs favour so well is a genuinely intriguing and exciting story that really leaves you wondering what is going on when it will kick off and how it will all work out its brave as well tackling the themes of an interracial relationship in the modern world and constructing one of the most paranoid and outlandish reasons for what could be behind it theres some light and humour as well with subtle little digs and nods thrown in that few will be unlikely to pick up on

as a horror fan this emerges as a genuinely pleasant surprise and my only regret is that i didnt see it sooner ",negative,1
345,345," there was enormous hype surrounding this film which is the main reason i watched it but also the main reason why i felt uncomfortable watching it for a long time before that if you are reading this its probably too late to not watch the trailer or read the commentaries on it but i am warning you anyway because it is a racially loaded film there are a lot of people who focus on that for some reason also while i gave it a full ten stars this is compared to other thrillers not movies in general

that said the film is a slow paced thriller things start cool then they get weirder and weirder until the final climax the story is ingenious but nothing you havent seen before in such movies what i found interesting was the acting the direction and the script so all the qualities that i enjoy in a movie jordan peele obviously did a good job but daniel kaluuya my man hit all the right notes the hallmark of a good thriller perhaps of any genre is that it has a main character that you can relate to and chris washington did all the things i believe a normal person would do in that situation

what this film did not have: jump scares well they had one but it was at the beginning and i can forgive it group of friends building fear off each other people that behave dumb hysterical or malevolent just to make the story less boring a predictable script well it was kind of predictable but id read the reviews hence my warning the story also lends itself to nice prequels and even sequels but i think it said what it was set to say i also liked that they didnt try to explain it too much: stuff just happens and its the point of view of the lead character that takes precedence over everything else while the role of the viewer is to interpret it as they see fit

what could have gone better: editing out the scene at the beginning with the other black guy

bottom line: a nailbiting success worth watching also check out the alternate ending of the movie that is roaming the internet out there",positive,9
346,346," the big surprise breakout hit of  get out has received a lot of critical acclaim and still should be considered to be an underrated movie thats how good it is the movie does not necessarily use the most original concept we have seen similar things with rosemarys baby or guess whos coming to dinner before but the movie mainly benefits from its clever storytelling  because sometimes its not about which story you are trying to tell sometimes its about how you are trying to tell it

the brilliant actors allison williams was surprisingly good catherine keener and bradley whitford were as good as was to be expected and boy was daniel kaluuya amazing added to the films success as well as its betterthanbrilliant directing jordan peele easily deserves an academy award nomination for his work as an director and its easy to see how much effort and lifeblood flew into the making of this movie get out is a horror movie but not necessarily a horror movie in the original sense of the word you wont find much blood just as you wont find many jump scares  in this movie its all about the tension meaningful dialogues more tension tension tension and its incredibly well done not a single scene has been wasted every little aspect of the movie has a purpose and ultimately thats what movies should be about: telling a story with so much love for its details that a viewer can simply sink into the movie and forget whats happening around him jordan peele has already mastered this art in his directing debut",positive,8
347,347," ive been a fan of horror movies and thrillers ever since i figured out how the tv worked always preferred older movies but also always kept my eyes and mind open for new instant classics the problem is that so very few really good horror movies come out nowadays and when i read exaggeratedly praising and positive reviews about an alleged new masterpiece i automatically become skeptical jordan peeles get out was such an example literally everybody acclaimed critics as well as ordinary mainstream audiences was madraving enthusiast about get out and now its even nominated for several oscars including best picture and best screenplay i honestly must admit i never expected that a film like this would ever become nominated for the most important categories in such a hypocrite and predetermined contest for the elite itll never win of course but still

it must be underlined that get out isnt groundbreakingly original extremely intelligent or a genuine masterwork of scripting there are however many things that the film  and the debuting director jordan peele in particular  does exceptionally well first and foremost the atmosphere although not featuring any graphic violence for the largest part of the film the atmosphere is continuously ominous and hinting at something dreadful that can occur at any given moment theres only a very selected number of classic horror films that uphold the theres something terribly wrong here sentiment for so long and it provides get out with the same unique vibe as pure classics like seconds rosemarys baby invasion of the body snatchers and the stepford wives the  original of course not the idiotic nicole kidman remake secondly you just cannot surpass peeles truly unsurpassable approach of racial differences without explicitly mentioning about racial tension or introducing obviously racist characters peele shows that racial segregation is irreversibly integrated in our modern day social culture this aspect of get out is indescribably unique in fact the harder the protagonists try to profile themselves as antiracist the more uncomfortable you get with them equally brilliant in this domain are the setting costumes and tiny little details the word slavery is never said out loud yet look at the armitage mansion the style of their household staff and the crucial role of cotton at a certain point thirdly and this is a joint effort with the ensemble cast the performances in get out are extremely high standard atypical role or not daniel kaluuya truly deserves the best actor nomination for his depiction of the insecure skeptical and visibly petrified chris washington

whats the story about then well im convinced that get out is one of those films for which they invented the rule of: the less you know the better personally i think that even rudimentary elements like the title or the cast list already reveal too much if i was jordan peele i would have named the film what is happening here or this doesnt feel right but of course i respect their choice from a marketing point of view im well aware of the fact that most reviews provide at least a brief synopsis or hint at vital twists in the third act but my advice is to know as little as possible before you watch i cant finish the review without mentioning that get out isnt flawless notably the comic relief aspect provided mainly by lil rel howery  isnt the least bit impressive and even somewhat misplaced in a way jordan peele is guilty of racial stereotyping himself with this although i reckon it was a deliberate choice hes a comedian after all",positive,8
350,350," idontget it i had high hopes to find out what was going on with these rich white folks when it was finally revealed what was going all i could think was huh i thought it was just downright moronic i did think the racial barriers the movie tried to overcome interracial relationships treating others with respect no matter what race they are etc was commendable but it wasnt enough to save the film that was a big let down for a horror fan who was looking forward to this movie

i loved this films use of metaphors others here have drawn attention to the themes of covert racism that is a disease of power control and dominance of whites over blacks whilst projecting a smiling friendly face yes absolutely and also about cultural appropriation admiration and envy for those attributes of a people where there is no respect for the people as fully human beings even often as not fully sentient beings less than animalsstuff to be exploited for ones own benefit i am very sure this is what the dark place alludes to being pushed into a place of nowhere as your world is gradually stolen from you

359,359, i was curious about the hype while i dont think it is an astonishing film or anything huge or completely new i cannot deny its a refreshingly original approach of the racism topic it is like  years a slave as a horror film in some ways at least also the twists the film contained kept me interested throughout the whole time although the midsection had some lengths but that was essential for the ending the acting was solid i really liked daniel kaluuya who i foresee to have a great career in hollywood such a charismatic and expressional actor who hit all the right tones with his performance also allison williams was decent and charismatic we will see more of her too always nice to see catherine keener bradley whitford was also fine caleb landry jones creepy as usual but he really is good at that would make a great joker one day great soundtrack that was only a small part of the excellent symbolism provided by jordan peele throughout the film the screenplay was the mvp for sure the ending revelation was a bit too out of this world and exaggerated for me the rest worked as a fine horror drama with a lot of depths,positive,8
360,360, in a cinema full of suspense movies corra does not revolutionize the genre but does in a daring and different way joining blockbuster to a highly artistic cinema we do not have that session of a fright for minutes and no shallow characters with ghostly characters complex characters high development social criticism a spectacular direction and great performances the daring novice jordan pele accustomed to acting and making his directorial debut recalls names like spielberg for betting that artistic side aligned to a good script is better than an appeal to call the public also has a stephen king side for transforming from something so mundane and natural into something that walks the linearity of the supernatural and occult and why not even hitchcock and even shyamalan  and at times he very much remembers scorseses the island of fear for jordan makes run a scrap of the best suspense has to offer even if it makes small mistakes run tells the story of chris daniel kaluuya a young black man who goes inside to meet his girlfriends parents rose allison williams arriving at the house chris begins to realize that family has something to hide  it seems even an afternoon session synopsis but the film goes beyond the script is great its linear it knows how to create a tension like few this the first second of the movie we notice that something is wrong this is the first the movie has a comic relief that bothers it it breaks the tension of the film the movie goes through more than an hour building a tension and instead of letting the viewer enter conjecture and reflect until a hypothesis about the construction of the film everything we imagine about the outcome is verbalized in a joke and this is horrible even the final solution being very creative the last scene does not please but its not all bad either the film criticizes a post modern slavery and the whole movie is surrounded by a racial tension that is suffocating even though they are stereotyped in some points the film makes us feel disgusted with characters not by themselves verbalize rampant racism but rather by hiding it this is new it is well built and leaves a very nice criticism unlike most suspense movies where tension has to be created run has an extremely clear photograph with a warm palette his photograph is almost cheerful permeated by a sensational soundtrack which goes from hiphop to classical music it is here that in due proportion jordan jokes about being hitchcock using the conductor and thermostat music of the audience the sound design does not have to be used to scare because the goal is not this it is to create tension and the soundtrack is completely perfect in that aspect another thing that is perfect is the game of camera that jordan uses also emulating hitchcock the camera does not stop filming a frame she has life because even with a few movements she creates an absolute tension always knowing to position herself in the right angle she films the characters in a way that even everyone smiling and cheerful you get stuck in the chair and clenched fist  because he knows that something is wrong we can not fail to mention the rhythm that is going on in an extremely visible rising wave and that he acts the acts excellently and contributes not only to the construction of the tension but the construction plot and character with a cast that even being little known is completely fabulous i will not mention all the actors because even the secondary characters haunt even that character in the background who does not have some annoying dialogue all are wonderful but i will cite our protagonist chris daniel kaluuya because it is what has a more different performance because it is what makes the pape feel uncomfortable and intuitive with the situation even with few words and few expressions daniel has an incredible posture and a verbal communication that speaks for itself this is very interesting which creates an actor of many facets and complete run has problems its true but its still exciting its different and its suspense in its fullest naturalness,positive,8
361,361," when chris daniel kaluuya has to go to visit his girlfriends parents he worries that they dont know he is black and that this might arouse problems yet upon meeting them they appear more than welcoming until strange occurrences in the house and to him start freaking him out and ultimately lead to the discovery of a terrible mystery

get out is possibly the culmination of the last few years of great horror and finally solidifies blumhouse productions as one of the main protagonists of the modern horror golden age other than introducing the movie going public to the mind of writerdirector jordan peele and his stunning sensibilities in genre filmmaking

what is possibly the most indicative aspect of this films incredible success is the molding of tones and as in all in great genre clashes it makes the comedy and the horror work together and function on the same beats that is something that is rarely found and when it does work it works to these incredible effects: there are moments where the tension is building and building to incredible stress levels and it gets released with comedy beats that are genuinely funny and laugh out loud moments as much as they are fuking creepy twisted moments that add to the whiteknuckled thriller aspect of the film

the picture is intense really intense it does not let you breathe for a second and i loved every moment of it it always had me on the tip of my toes i did not know what was coming next sometimes i didnt know whether to laugh or to be scared and it just got me to this place of being totally locked into it with my body it affected me physically and that is one of the best compliments you could ever give to a motion picture peele knows every trick in the box of how to play the audience and he rarely ever makes a false step in guiding us through the story the scene weave is flawless and every new bit of information is delivered at the perfectly right time and escalates to twists and twists on twists which never lost me and actually ratcheted up the tension

it is clear that there is a lot of influences moving peele around and it is a testament to his cinematic ability that they are never bluntly thrown at your face instead they are used in a complementary way to bring us a delicious mix of everything edgar wright quentin tarantino roman polanski all transpire beautifully through this film yet possibly the best one that we get is hitchcock on one side we see the homages and the subtle similarities that only make the film better on another it just made me remember why hitchock was and is the best and why his lessons are universal

there isnt much to point out here on the negative side the film flows and hits you without having any stumbles on the way there are little moments where the quirky off beat atmosphere gets amplified to  and you may start to feel a little overwhelmed but it picks up immediately and doesnt really leave any trace of that on the film i think that a  or so minutes cut down could have benefited the film in making it even more hard hitting as there are little moments that drag and a couple of plot beats that are explained to the audience shamelessly when they could have been entrusted to work it out by themselves

get out is a hard hitting comedyhorror incredibly original and fresh and made with a stunning craft in filmmaking especially considering this is a feature debut it scared me it made me laugh out loud and it made me sweat a lot i really enjoyed it",positive,8
362,362," lets face it the horror genre seems to have got even more stale than ever lately sure ever since the texas chainsaw massacre kind of launched the slasher subgenre of mainstream horror many films have followed that particular layout especially when teens were the leads however im pleased to say that get out is actually a breath of ‚Äì pretty horrific ‚Äì fresh air

im going to get the word out the way straight away ‚Äì awkward yes this films primary emotion it generates in you is not fear disgust or dread its awkwardness an emotion weve all felt from time to time and one more associated with turning up to work in trainers in an office full of people in smart shoes than full blown horror however theres more to it than thatwe meet a young midtwenties couple who are returning to her parents house in a small but respectable town in middle america nothing particularly out of the ordinary there but chris washington is a black man and his girlfriend rose armitage is white again nothing that would raise an eyebrow in most places these days but this is ‚Äì at heart and despite its overall awkwardness ‚Äì a horror movie after all

when this black man arrives in his potential inlaws house theres quite an uncomfortable feeling in the air theyre not racists or bigots just people who havent really experienced people of other cultures and races ‚Äì queue the start of the awkwardness they do their best to make him feel welcome constantly referencing supposedly black culture in an effort to make him feel at home but theres still that awkwardness in the air that something else is going on this is the point where i cant say too much more without dipping my toe into the territory of spoilers i will just say that if you thought ben stiller had it bad in meet the parents you wont believe what poor chris washington has to go through eventually the awkwardness and uncomfortable atmosphere cracks and get out turns into what its meant to be ‚Äì something pretty horrible its definitely a pleasant change from the slasherzombie horror films which seem to be infesting the cinema these days the closest film i could liken it to may be a certain other dark classic from the seventies starring amongst others nannette newman but ill leave you to wait and see any slight similarities it does touch on quite a few modern issues with race and the perception thereof however its never preachy or annoying by trying to put its message over the fact that its a dark disturbing film first social commentary later

get outs primary strength is its two young leads they have to be believable as a normal couple who you can relate to in order for us to buy into their plight and they do daniel kaluuya chris washington ultimately carries the film and its impossible not to sympathise for him when the bad stuff really starts to happen all in all whatever your politics as long as you enjoy good solid slowburning horror films which gradually crank up the tension you really do need to watch this",positive,8
363,363," i must say that i was delightfully please by watching this movie it is rare to find talent in hollywood these days so when a movie like this comes along and gives us a script and performance we have our faith that all is not lost in the art of cinema there are a lot of hitchcockian elements in this picture despite some comedic scenes and the actors involved all keep us hooked in our seats i also got the feel that there were some elements of h p lovecraft sewn into this story i dont know if that was deliberate accidental or just my modest impression but the writers have truly outdone themselves bravo

364,364," dont just watch the movie

i think the trailer gives too much away read the very basic synopsis and if thats what you are after in a movie watch it

its well done well told and strange there are things you see coming a miles away and others you dont from the trailer i felt i had already watched the movie guessed the twists and ending

although the ending was different to what i expected i later read that it was changed from the original script due to recent events which is why it looks a little out of place but actually might work better

dont want to say much more just advise anyone interested in it to just watch and not look too much into it beforehand",positive,8
365,365," i dont usually do reviews but i can say this movie is worth watching it may not be super good but it is the kind of movie that will keep your interest as you are watching i refrain anyone to know so much about the movie cause it is better that way i can also say that this movie is well written for most part like for the part with the police and the protagonist which i just realize now lol i also love the satisfying ending the protagonist is also not dumb or stupid until the end cause i think he acts like what a normal person will do on that kind of situation without second thinking so if you are in doubt like myself at first just go see it and enjoy your time

366,366," a young africanamerican man visits his caucasian girlfriends mysterious family estate this movie is quite unique and in its own way the moment it starts we are thrown into the typical girlfriendboyfriend plot along with the meet the parents however what makes this movie so special is how it takes all the old classic clich√©s and turns it into something extremely original we all know from the beginning that there is something wrong but the problem is the audience can never figure out what is wrong and the direction the film is going to go

the acting was spot on by everybody especially daniel kaluuya and alison williams the direction by jordan peele was surprisingly spot on and he manages to mix horror and humor into this extremely well it also moves along at a good pace and it keeps you guessing what the heck is going on the music was spot on as well very unsettling extremely over the top but it suites each scene perfectly i dont think theres anything i would change in the movie

by the time you get to the end and you have figured everything out it really does make you wander how they managed to pull it all off there is a lot of racial stereotype in this movie i think it works though it never really goes full on with the racial stuff but there are several scenes that may offend or even just make people shake their heads but in the end its just a movie and its for pure entertainment the autistic reviewers give this  stars it really is a great and unique film we both highly recommend it to all of you its already getting attention at the mtv movie awards so theres a sign its very popular the autistic reviewers check us out on facebook or instagram",positive,10
367,367," jordan peele makes his very interesting directorial debut in racial commentaryhorror film get out i really enjoyed this movie the lead daniel kaluuya was really good in this movie and he portrays such an interesting character the supporting cast was also amazing including betty gabriel who plays the housekeeper georgina

what was really great about get out is its ability to blend comedy with horror tropes so this is really something to congratulate jordan peele on in his directorial debut and it would be very interesting to see what he has to come i believe that many of jordans personal experiences come through in this film as well i do believe hearing jordan peele commenting in one interview about how he often feels uncomfortable if he was the only black person amongst a group of white people that sense of paranoia really comes through and is fully understandable and relatable for a nonwhite viewer like me however jordan peele takes a more comedic route with this adding some light heartedness to an otherwise serious topic

the horror and underlying mystery of this movie was also really great and the build up to the ultimate reveal was a very good process of which tension arise so the horror aspect was taken care of also",positive,9
368,368," there are some films which you never want to end there are some films that have a lifetime lasting impact on you there are some films that once the credits roll you gasp in awe and stop for a minute and think holy ssshhh that was a work of genius

if you cant tell i think get out is one such film in fact i think it might be the best horror film ive seen since the shining and i dont say that lightly

massive respect to jordan peels for writing and directing this masterpiece please keep the horrors coming the genre needs you

the casting was spot on and the acting was top notch as was the music composition

deserves a couple of oscars for sure

370,370," let me get this out of the way early: this is  a remake of the movie the skeleton key

now that that is out of the way i will start by saying that i really enjoyed this film the cast and acting was great the music score was phenomenal and perfectly fitting with each scene the camera work was above average plenty of tension breaking moments of levity that were really well executed

one of my biggest gripes about this movie though has to be the pacing of how they reveal the story you see the twist if you can even call it that a mile away the movie is aware of this fact and nearly breaks the th wall to the audience in recognizing this fact im not sure this entirely makes up for it though as it just comes off as generally lazy writing

all in all great flick if you enjoyed the movie skeleton key you will enjoy this",positive,8

373,373," get out since i have seen the trailer i had promising expactaitions but leave the expectations here they dont matter because someone couldve expected something more or something else

here we talk about how effecting is the movie and it is so so well the plot the story the screenplay the cast everything matched exactly perfect and the result is an incredible film that i loved yes i love that kind of movies it wasnt horror although there were moments of course which were compilling and they were scary shocking but that was great made mystery thriller it was on higher level on higher effort with such brilliant power

everything fits it is ideal i dont have anything i could say there would be more but even if i had it is never for bad but this movie was sinless

the cast was awesome solid and brilliant daniel kaluuya was incredible i have no other words

i just watched it and wanted to write about it right away so i could say it as clear as i could and to think about it a bit more now i am going to sleep with the though of the great work all the staff had done bravo well well done",positive,10
375,375," not since blacula in the early seventies has a brilliant africanamerican film electrified the horror audience and changed the way the mainstream audience thinks about race horror and the power of storytelling but where blacula was patterned after the relatively mild almost romantic horror films of the early thirties get out is a relentlessly terrifying thriller that captures the stifling shocking paranoia of rosemarys baby the stepford wives and even darker classics like the manchurian candidate and a clockwork orange

by now everyone knows the basic plot  a young black man visits his white girlfriends parents in the luxurious home deep in the country this journey is an ironic reversal of marlowes journey up the congo in heart of darkness daniel kaluuya plays chris the innocent victim turned hero who becomes the perfect symbol of the courage decency and humanity that white america so often refuses to acknowledge in young black men no one else has said it but it seems to me that kaluuyas performance is strengthened by his uncanny resemblance to a great black actor who left us much too soon  howard rollins the movie plays with the fact that chris is much like the black officer rollins played in a soldiers story  the honest observer the courageous truth seeker the lone survivor there are moments that seem torn right out of the earlier classic just in the way chris shows so much sadness with his eyes as the other black characters are demeaned and humiliated

but this is not just one mans story allison williams as rose armitage is a revelation again its astonishing the way this gifted and sensationally gorgeous young actress channels the aura of earlier icons early in the picture rose comes across as exactly the character a young jane fonda or katharine hepburn might have played shes the aristocratic ingenue with a prim demeanor and passion lurking underneath seemingly cool but full of red blood and passion as well as sympathy for the less fortunate the genius of this movie is that it takes this archetype so beloved by white liberals and then transforms the character in ways that are both terrifying and darkly funny

catherine keener as mama armitage was equally unforgettable id seen her in a lighthearted comedy hamlet  with steve coogan i noticed then that she has a way of striking sparks sounding discordant notes making the story turn dark just by her very presence here shes even more sensational

this movie is one of those rare classics that feels totally original  yet at the same time its full of tributes to earlier films you cant see chris tied up in a chair and shedding tears without picturing alex in a clockwork orange the use of hypnosis brings back memories of the manchurian candidate nothing ever feels fake or added for effect  get out just resembles those earlier classics because of its power style and depth

get out is a movie that has no weak spots no slow scenes no bad performances its the most economical thriller ive ever seen you will not forget this young mans journey into a uniquely american vision of hell",positive,7
379,379, this firsttime director manages to create an unbelievable and surprising horror flick that was hysterically funny at parts the film is filled with good performances and fun characters with a realistic storyline and quite relatable to many people not the supernatural bit though  the meeting the parents bit the scenes when the couple arrives at the parents estate are fun and enjoyable to watch much like the scenes when the supernatural stuff begins the film as a whole is quite creepy and features a disturbing performance played brilliantly by caleb landry jones the film could be classed as a horror comedy though mainly due to lilrel howerys hysterical performance with his random outbursts that resulted in the entire cinema completely losing it this benefited the film as it created a fun cinema experience that you can enjoy with a group of friends some may argue that the comedy element may take away from the horror aspect of the film but id have to disagree there is a perfect mix between both that results in a fantastic modern horror flick and the best ive seen in a very long time also this is definitely a contender for my favourite film of  so far i absolutely recommend this brilliant horrorcomedy as it delivers on all levels and i cant wait to see more from jordan peel in the future,positive,8
382,382," i have until very recently had a problem sleeping you see when i was in bed id be lying there and id suddenly have enraged thoughts as to the oscars being too white words can not convey just grief stricken and tortured i was knowing that once again the academy awards were going to gift accolades to white film makers once again damaged me mentally  emotionally and physically thankfully all this was cured when moonlight won the best picture this year all the worlds wrongs had now been righted in what must be the most important event ever since the big bang  billion years ago now the only thing bothering me is that every time i watch a horror thriller is that the token black character gets bumped off early along comes get out which has received universal praise and features a black directorscreenwriter in jordan peele and stars black actor daniel kaluuya so theres no way a clich√©d thriller where the first scene features a token black character getting killed

 suggestive spoilers 

so the first scene features a black man walking along a dark lonely street  then hes attacked i suppose this is an example of post modernism thankfully this is more than tokenism because were introduced to the main character chris washington who is african american and has a white girlfriend rose who drives him to her middle class wasp parents home theres two things that can happen at this scenario one is the middle wasp class parents slam the door in their face and disown their daughter the other scenario is boyfriend is greeted as a respected new addition to the household and he soon wishes the parents had slammed the door in his face

to be fair to jordan peele he has made a fairly effective and enjoyable tongue in cheek horror thriller the only thing he can be criticised for is that the polite middle class white anglo saxon protestant characters constantly reminded me a little too much of the stepford wives apart from that its an entertaining film the downside is that its really nothing more than that and im slightly surprised as well as puzzled by the hype and acclaim surrounding get out it goes without saying that the hype works against watch the film but dont expect a masterwork of cinema otherwise youll be left with a feeling of disappointment",positive,10
384,384," it took me a while to get to this one and its because i knew the general plotline and i thought maybe it would be a little too hamfisted for me to enjoy and i also knew that any movie with that kind of premise would be adored by the critics whether it was actually good or not

turns out this movie managed to be nuanced deeply unsettling heartpumping thrilling and downright hilarious all at once it really hits every mark you could ever want from a movie like this daniel kaluuya did a spectacular job and although there are a lot of excellent survivortrope characters played by excellent actors in a lot of great horrorslasherthrillers i honestly think kaluuya takes the cake for being the absolute best which is not something i say lightly since i am a huge fan of thrillerslasherhorrors with the survivor turning the tables during the climax particularly when they have a unique twist a la youre next the house of the devil babysitter basically what im trying to say is that while this movie is in a lot of ways a very particular trope that is popular right now and that i happen to love it also manages to be incredibly fresh and unpredictable

i found myself wanting to rewatch the movie immediately after finishing it and if youre like me and you find the white people are all veiled racists messaging in a movie incredibly offputting which is the reason i stupidly avoided this classic for so long just forget all that and watch the movie anyways when it comes to the racial element i think theres a number of different ways you could read into it and imo that was entirely intentional

the important and enjoyable part of this movie i think is just how well it puts the viewer in chris shoes such that you cant help but feel the confusion suspicion terror and then dread at all the exact same moments he does even if you know precisely whats coming that may not sound like a lot but particularly for a seasoned horror movie fan its exceedingly rare that a movie hits the notes at just the right times in just the right ways to put the audience right into the protagonists shoes every single time its terrifying unsettling funny and satisfying in a way most horror movies try desperately to be but very rarely succeed in actually being get out succeeds over and over and over and over just watch it",negative,1
385,385," finally saw get out one of the most talked about movies of  and i must say this work from director jordan peele was interesting as its a take on society and a spin on race and class as its blended with themes and elements of drama and horror and the film twist with suspense its a real guesser and almost mind numbing

the story is that of an interracial couple chrisnewcomer daniel kaluuya and roseallison williams from hbos girls who one weekend drive to visit the well to do parents of rose and from the start chris feels out of place even though rose swears that her parents are not against black people still all of the hired help and servants are black it seems like slave days and the talk and questions used around chris make him uncomfortable

then strange happenings begin is it real or is just chris seeing things this film has you thinking too as its a plague as its like chris is falling deeper and deeper into this secret society as his entire mind and world is changing really this picture is a strange and different style of horror suspense drama that twist with a spin of race and social themes",positive,9
386,386, the less you know about this movie before you watch it the better its a creepy delicious thriller and one where even when you think you know what might be going on theres more to it than you realize there are elements that feel derivative but on the other hand director jordan peele tells this story well and it feels fresh and intelligent daniel kaluuya and allison williams turn in very nice performances and the supporting cast is solid as well i loved lil rel howery who plays the friend a tsa agent who tries to help from afar there are many great moments ‚Äì the round of bingo led by the father kaluuya seeing the pictures of williams and her expression on that last one and the effects going to the sunken place it also puts a mirror up to how white people in real life even wellmeaning ones sometimes talk to africanamericans in their attempts to relate to them or be cool ‚Äì stilted with references that often bring up race and at least sometimes subtly racist how great it was to see a diverse cast and to see this perspective without it being delivered in a heavyhanded manner its not original enough to be in a list of greatest ever thrillers but its solid and enjoyable from beginning to end,positive,8

what did offend me was the utterly generic dialogue acting and script which all couldve easily been lifted from any other alsoran us horrorthriller from the last  years the way everyone in these kind of movies all talk in that vaguely disinterested pseudocryptic casually sweary ohsokewl wayit really gets on my big black breasts

i would have given this movie a  if it wasnt for the unnecessary language by the way using foul language only serves one purpose you dont have anything intelligent to say in a sentence think about it

404,404," what a fresh wind of creativity exuding from that little movie

and by little theres no disrespect meant of course just highlighting the notsotrivial fact that this is a directorial debut from jordan peele with an actor who was relatively unknown mr daniel keluuya and yet what weve got here is a gamechanger one of these little movies popping out of nowhere but leaving in your mind the constant impression that they will be standing in cinematic memories for a long long time thats how good get out is

and i wont insist enough on its originality if we were in  i would have gone straight to the point but were in  a year where creativity seems to have been declining for good: disney recycles the classics with the cheap excuse of moneygrabbing liveaction milking on previously built successes and big directors take the easy way of remaking rebooting and chaining up sequels with no super vision and a lot of supervision a time where the star wars series became a soap space opera and for all the noises these movies make all is desperately quiet on the cinematic western front

now jordan peeles film is made of old stuff but only in the way it totally deconstructs all the usual infuriating tropes of the horror genre and features for once a protagonist whos smart enough to figure out when things go suspicious and a sidekick who incarnates our own point of view and never goes for the facepalm inducting choice if lilrel howery manages to slip through the image of the helpful comic relief keluuya is simply just too good for words and his performance covers such a wide range of emotions that i doubt the academy will overlook him

now its been three paragraphs and i cant get to the story yet dont take it as pompousness this is the very indicator of my enthusiasm i dont need to tell the story because its so good i would rather invite anyone to go see whats so good in it lets just say that it opens like guess whos coming to dinner where chris washington is getting ready for meeting the rich family of his white girlfriend rose alison williams in a secluded house the armitages who cant stop delivering glorifying compliments on obama or jesse owens yet hire black housekeepers who look so uncle tom its painful to watch

but the parts meant to raise our suspicion i wont get too wordy on them shine because of their roles within the plot and the various reactions of keluuya at first hes not really in his element and tries to fit in but his performance is so nuanced and subtle that sometimes you can feel the crispation in his smile the unease in his eyes and the way he always reaches for an eye contact with allison with the fragility of a child begging for a parents reassuring sign bradley whitford and catherine keener plays the armitage parents and theyre good at feigning emotions so that our suspicion is never pushed to that level where we expect the worst peele engages us in a harrowing journey where each step seems to take us downer toward a descent into hell but no matter what were never one step ahead of chris

the plot thickens with the first display of racism from the son played by caleb landry jones and a mysterious group of white hosts coming for a garden party and where each one indulges to one of these patronizingly racist commentsturning slowly the film to an experience √† la rosemarys baby where you can tell theres some conspiracy going on but people are so occasionally friendly were tempted like chris to keep on a cool facade and give the benefit of the doubt of course once chris gets why hed better get out theres no way to get out and the film turns into one of the best horror movie experiences of recent years i would go as far as saying that the film is an instant classic

the action and the thrills escalate driven by the usual horror elements the deserted houses the jump scares a s√©ance of hypnosis that alone should guarantee an oscar nomination for keluuya but the film never recycles plot devices it reinvents their use in a way that respects our intelligence indeed get out is meant for viewers whove seen enough horror movies not to be tricked yet to better trick us the film has an edge a level of intelligence that is so bold and daring it can almost flirt with reverse parody and maybe for that level of selfawareness it has been nominated in the comedy category for the golden globes still theres nothing comedic in the performances although there are moments in the film that make you smile a lot often in a disturbing way

so yes this is a little movie that stands above all todays creations in a way i didnt think was possible let me explain this: ive often said that today you could only make big budget blockbuster movies if you had a name or an independent movie that tries to be socially relevant you know that deals with racism politics environment men and women homosexuality etc it would be a lie to say that get out isnt relevant its perhaps one of the most intelligent recent movies to deal with racism especially in the way it highlights the mix of fascination and revulsion where the worst forms of racism are rooted if it wasnt for that fascination the plot wouldnt exist

so yes get out is disturbing and subversively brilliant but the social commentary is only one of the facets of its greatness the film also works on the thrills department and the way the action unfolds from one reveal to another until the climactic and satisfying conclusion and thats only after a first viewing i just realized that i failed to notice many hints and plot points and i guess itll take me more viewings to get each time more of get outs brilliance",negative,4

407,407," this is not just an overrated movie this is a terrible movie lets get that straight first and foremost

in all aspects from the screenplay to the art direction and film techniques this movie is trite below average and exploitative the acting is awful the plot is a refried dumb cliche of a lowbrow dumb horror movie there is no drama no comedy no horror nothing thats worth saving this movie conveys nothing of value it has zero emotion is not even so bad its entertaining its so bad is frustating and i wanted to honor the name and get out of the roommake no mistake this is even bad for the b movie category and the low budget slasher horror genre and that is saying something i see no other reason for the hype other than an obvious political agenda and that alone not be so terrible if the movie wasnt as bad as it is and its themes so shallow and mean spirited

this movie poses no debate and ask no questions worth considering it simply puts forward it racism and expects you to praise it for it which the acedemy seemed to do ive never been head over heels about the oscars but nominating this is a travesty even today it is ¬∑number one or at least top five in movies of the decade list showing how journalists and professional critics are in a debacle and so badly disconnected from reality the audiences and moviemaking they basically get paid to make clowns of themselves give banal excuses to praise smut while they insult the audiences intelligences throwing around buzzwords and smug political slogans  becoming a satire of themselves",positive,8

it is always nice to see movie with some twists and also those that give you some food for thought but sometimes the twists are for the twist sake this is not the case here everything makes sense and in more than one level the atmosphere of underlying racism is done in a way that makes people from across the world who did not have contact with usa slavery issues get good insight but the movie is so much more than this and will surprise you make you think and leave you intellectually and emotionally satisfied so few movies can do this as competently and decently as this one this is one smart movie

422,422," this is jordan peeles feature directorial debut and whats interesting here is that get out is uncharted territory for him as he comes from a comedic background but watching this movie it felt like hes been directing horror his whole life to put it simply the guy knocks it out of the park

its an artfully crafted and remarkably accomplished debut he exploits an atmosphere impregnated with tension and skillfully choreographs an escalation of unrelenting suspense and crowdpleasing thrills the camerawork was absolutely ingenious theres a scene involving hypnosis in particular that had my jaw hitting the floor i loved how they visually achieved that heightened state of suggestibility on a visual level

get out is as much satire as it is horror though and its most impressive feat is how masterfully it blends the two together i cant remember the last time i saw a movie that so seamlessly shifts from sequences of jubilant laughter to instances of insidious horror in a matter of minutes

writing satire is tough writing good satire is even tougher and writing good horrorsatire is as rare of a commodity as you get in the film industry these days to achieve this a film must have exquisite timing and nearprefect pacing which is exactly what get out has the runtime is  minutes yet it felt more like an hour i guess i got so invested in this engaging story that i lost all sense of time which is what you ultimately want in any movie really

daniel kaluuya showcases his acting chops with an impressive range of emotions its not necessarily what he says but what he doesnt say that has the biggest impact other standouts include allison williams bradley whitford and catherine keener id be remiss if i didnt mention comic lil rel howery who plays tsa agent rod aka the protagonists best friend hes definitely a scenestealer breaking the films uncanny tension with a number of gutbusting interludes

while get out sets out to mainly entertain and shock its also accompanied with some poignant social commentary it shines light on the aspect of ourselves that wed rather not acknowledge no matter how much we try to convince ourselves that were above implicit stereotyping or forming preconceptions we arent peele uses this unavoidable unflattering truth to draw out anxiety and then he uses that anxiety as fuel for the film itself

get out is one of the best movies to come out of  thus far i cant recommend it enough",negative,1
425,425," get out is an innovative and entertaining movie: a mix of comedy thriller horror dramatic grotesque noir sentimental and social satire that succeeds as a horror movie even without the use of monstrosity jump scare or blood but thanks to really disquieting shots and facial expressions that keep the viewer alert it is also a criticism of certain white people who voted for obama: this movie unveils a less cliche more politically correct and treacherous face of racism

the actors are uniformly excellent daniel kaluuya is crucial to establishing the reality of the situation he never overplays his character and you never catch him acting allison williams is a pleasant surprise id only known her from girls and she shows a whole new potential here lakeith stansfield is a star in the making its just that simple everything i see him in he is impressive the rest of the cast consists of some of the most reliable character actors working today including a personal favorite: stephen root in a very surprising role

430,430," get out was written and directed by jordan peele and was his directorial debut and a hot item on his resume it is too

daniel kaluuya sicario plays africanamerican chris washington who nervously takes a trip upstate to meet the parents of his cute white girlfriend rose allison williams the parents dean bradley whitford best known as josh lyman from the west wing and missy catherine keener  captain phillips are extremely welcoming

but the weekend coincides with an annual gathering of family and friends and events quickly take a left turn into the twilight zone with antismoking hypnosis and a bizarre game of bingo where the win is so substantial that playing becomes a no brainer can chris get out with his mind still intact before its too late

this is a really clever script by peele the film baits you into thinking this is some redneckinterracialrevenge flick but actually the colour of the skin is almost irrelevant or is it this angle is left deliciously vague some of the filming is spectacularly creepy with the hypnosis scene being reminiscent to me of the excellent under the skin and never has a teaspoon in a cup of tea been a more devastating weapon

i seemed to have talked at length this year in this blog on the subject of the physics of horror: the story elements hanging together in a satisfying ‚Äì albeit sometimes in an unbelievable ‚Äì way get out delivers this to perfection keeping its powder dry until the closing moments of the film before delivering a series of satisfying ah relevatory moments

while the physics of the film is good the biology is bonkers featuring a plot point from the terrible first episode of the rd season of the original star trek if you can be bothered to look that up but ill forgive this parking my incredulity to salute what i think is one of the years most novel and impressive lowbudget indie horror films

432,432," some people go to the movies for escapism  for a diversion a welldeserved break from real life then there are those who frequent the cinema for elucidation of deeper truths or explication unpacking sociopolitical concerns of the time somehow somewhat amazingly comedy veteran jordan peele has crafted a film perfectly geared to appeal to either camp  and as his directorial debut to boot get out is an unforgettable cinematic experience tackling subtext almost eerily prescient in the wake of raciallymotivated hate crimes rallies and dangerously escalating discrimination both explicit and pervasively subtle but lest prospective viewers pass it by as a soapbox diatribe peele opts to frame his discourse through an ingeniously undidactic psychological horror genre lens think the stepford wives crossed with guess whos coming to dinner thrown into a hitchcockian psycho blender and churned with a table saw its fiendishly eloquent but almost outlandishly absurdist and it may be the most clever bonkers nailbiting irreverently ingenious and grimly fun time at the movies this year

if that sounds like a confusing cocktail of diametrically opposed elements it is yet somehow peele shakes stirs and serves the perfect filmic entr√©e disguised as an aperitif its rollercoaster ride of emotions and response somehow working seamlessly as an ingeniously homogeneous film social satire and the horror genre have long gone hand in hand in fact we all go a little mad sometimes could practically serve as the tagline for the movie that is   but peele finds that true horror lies in the crushing weight of raciallymotivated microaggressions sprinkled out by the caste of sometimes wellintentioned nouveauliberals doing their best to counteract privilege by being a little too earnest in telling the only african american in the room that they wouldve voted for obama for a third term if they could peeles satire may be barbed  perhaps too much so not to hit a nerve for some audiences  but its teeth are razor sharp capturing the intricacies of moments of discomfort almost imperceptible apart from those experiencing them in both hysterical and cringeworthy detail his airtight script is succinct but extraordinarily precise with dialogue rife with clever wordplay watch for all of the seemingly innocent inclusions of the word black in innocuous conversation and coy foreshadowing so intricate the film practically necessitates repeat viewings to drink it all in

and just when youre engrossed in cackling and cringing under your breath at the savage act  satire peele cordially reminds you that youre here watching a horror film  and hits you with no holds barred of course hes never fully let you fully forget it with a chillingly surreal prologue and poetic flourishes sneakily maintaining a mood of general unease protagonists chris and rose hit a deer on the way to visiting her parents in the countryside some of these are artsy piece of tonesetting foreshadowing some are playful red herrings some are both with enough narrative bread crumbs scattered to elicit some painful i shouldve known facepalming in the third act for all but the most eagleeyed viewers and none are extraneous all firmly in service of forwarding both the films horror tropes and reallife horror intertexts in equal grim measure case in point: the sunken place  a bout of hypnosisparalysis chris is subjected to that has the film at its most claustrophobically terrifying while also providing a crushingly perfect metaphor for feeling consistently beaten down and repressed in a closeted discriminatory culture

as things take an increasingly chilling turn for the macabre and peeles pitchperfect pacing stews tension to a frantic fever pitch with the effortless nonchalance of a seasoned veteran get outs ultimate rather sordid gag is how easy it is to miss the forest for the trees we find ourselves tempted alongside chris to write off his spinetingling experiences as paranoia or the film artistically extrapolating on the experience of racial discrimination when the reality could simply be that things are in fact so much worse than the fears a lifetime of living in polite society has taught him to dismiss as overzealous the realization starts witty then becomes almost overwhelmingly sobering and theres the definitive microcosmic distillation of the films audience experience as a whole

daniel kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as chris establishing a baseline of perfectly affable nonchalance to make the rawness with which he radiates horror at the indignities hes increasingly subjected to all the more harrowing still kaluuyas work is too sophisticated for rote final girl horror reactions and a couple of leftturn character choices skirting obvious hollywood moral choices keep chris enigmatic enough to remain compelling throughout allison williams is equally terrific perfecting a peppy charisma with just enough of a highlystrung edge to ensure she equally dodges clich√© throughout catherine keener and bradley whitford embody that particular strain of friendliness that is somehow icier and more imperious with every smile to almost unnerving effect while lilrel howery is reliably hilarious pulling doubleduty as the films bombastic comic relief and incredulous moral centre finally caleb landry jones infuses his inherent slithering creepiness into a drunken jock archetype to perfectly unnerving effect while stephen roots warm eloquence provides a welcome foil to the tonedeaf effete posturing threatening to suffocate chris

if ever there were a single film to distill the madness of the sociopolitical climate of the past year and make sense of it with acid wit and worldweary humour its peeles unforgettable get out its psychological horror film as inventive and groundbreaking as it is sadistically playful its an unnervingly timely walloping deconstruction of the intimate intricacies of privilege and prejudice for the im not racist but crowd in short prospective viewers would do well to follow the advice of its title  get out of your house routine deeply entrenched mindset and drink in what hindsight will invariably decree the most illustrative and fiendishly enjoyable film of the year

433,433," rant begins

its really interesting to me that people are getting triggered and claiming that the movie is extremely racist or something when rose says that her father will vote obama for rd time she is not trying to deceive chris these people arent thinking black people as beneath them every one of them envies a different point of them one of them thinks they are fast one thinks they are cooler in this modern age etc the point is these people are not neonazis or white supremacists these people are liberals who would actually vote for obama again what this movie criticize is liberal people who when trying to be liberal to black people make things worse im no way claiming that all liberals are like thatobviously as i am white liberal person but yeah

rant ends

the premise of the movie could be better as there was no need to bring science fiction stuff they couldve just rolled with the lets make them slaves by hypnotism because i mean brain exchange didnt really add something to story other than unrealism saying that there was a huge tension until the later parts of the movie and there was a certain sickness if i had to say i mean psychological aspect of the movie really creeped me out

435,435," i loved this movie this year has been full of sht i have seen very few movies this year that made me walk out of the theatre with a smile on my face the only movies i have seen this year that i really loved are split logan and get out

this movie perfectly combines horror comedy and social commentary and it is the good kind of social commentary because its not just saying some stupid sht about how racist we are it actually makes you think and provides some very interesting ideas that really enrich the experience

the performances are all great the main actor was great in this film like he was in black mirror and in sicario the rest of the actors also did a very good job and the comic relief character was hilarious i laughed every time that dude was on screen

the horror or thriller aspect of this movie was great there were many scenes in which i was hugging the arm rest out of anxiety the whole purpose that this whitefolks have with chris actually terrified me the only bad thing about the horror is that this movie actually uses the someone passed through the hallway and the score becomes loud for a second which is really cheap

the comedy was also pretty good the director understood that this whole idea had some level of absurdity to it so he used that to the advantage of the film and created some scenes in which the whole movie theatre was bursting with laughter i believe that the movie handled pretty well the transitions between the horror and the comedy

the social commentary is also pretty good it talks about a whole other level or racism one in which the characters have passiveaggressive racism i thought that it really enriched the movie experience

the whole tone and feeling of the movie is great you feel awkward when the character feels awkward and scared when he is scared

the score and cinematography are great and really made this movie have a much cooler style

also the movie had quite a lot of metaphors and symbols

definitely go support this movie it is really a unique and fun experience",positive,10
436,436," get out is a superb piece of horror with sharp sometimes funny and always interesting social commentary that walks the line between classic horror conventions and a modern revitalised genre form perfectly its an excellent debut from jordan peele who moulds his clever tale together with a great cast interesting camerawork and a welcome dose of heavy tension and menace

first of all go see this film as blindly as you can teaser trailers are acceptable anything else could ruin or spoil the moment i made the effort to go in relatively blind through part laziness and part active ignorance avoiding critics reviews and switching off the radio if people started talking about it the premise alone should be enough to interest most people and peeles name attached to the writing and directing should be able to persuade most sceptics that said whether you like or dislike horror make the time for this one

the cast is all around excellent though special praise must go to daniel kaluuya who despite the temptations of genre keeps his acting naturalistic completely believable and watchable catherine keener and bradley whitford also deserve special mentions for their parts as do marcus henderson and betty gabriel for their creepy turns peele doesnt let the cast carry the film however with some interesting creative and above all else unnerving camerawork and great writing throughout lest we forget that peele wrote directed and produced this

beyond everything peele has succeeded in balancing the genre demands of his piece with the social commentary he puts forth there is a danger with any horror film that the social issues at hand overwhelm the story or that the story and plot dampen any wider concerns to nearly nothing there is interesting and at times genuinely uncomfortable moments created by the issues our main character faces and situations he deals with peele has got the balance spot on and the film is also helped by moments of well timed comic relief

debuts are always a double edged sword which half the time leave you feeling underwhelmed and the other half overwhelmed setting up inevitable disappointments for whatever follows up peele has proved himself a skilled and inventive director who can tackle complex and fascinating subject matter in a horrific fashion as much as he can in his comedy he has said he has many more stories of social demons to come over the next ten or so years i am looking forward to them already",positive,8
438,438," i decided to go watch the movie after i saw the high reviews about it and when i went to the theater i was ultimately enjoyed everything about the movie is amazing  interesting and exciting from the very beginning you can feel the strange setting  the strange reactions from the white family you feel that theres something wrong and this makes you more concentrated in the movie and not feeling bored at all the movie really takes you from the very beginning and i like that kind of movies which has fast temp then the second part of the movie when everything is revealed you can sympathize with the hero as if youre him  you really feel sorry for him  you feel like you really want to help and that makes you more concentrated and following the afterwards scenes where you need to know more and keep thinking how he will react to his situations what will happen next and all that sort of questions keep coming on your mind

in the end you can see all the pieces of the puzzle coming together and you began to connect the scenes with themselves

on the other hand and in spite of that this movie is a horror movie but there is a very high comedy scenes in the movie that would really make you laugh so loud and this was very very very interesting

i really enjoyed the whole movie and im really so thankful to the writer  director jordan peele because he really made my day and because this is the best movie so far in  really i do appreciate his hard work and im really looking forward to all his next projects

last thing i gave it  out of  just because i wished if the movie could tell us more about the stories of the other victims  this depends on the viewers some people like it to be left like that for our imaginations and some people like me love it when more details in more scenes are shot and added to the movie 

go watch get out all the people",positive,8
440,440," get out is the directorial debut by comedian jordan peele from the comedy central show key and peele as well as mad tv unlike his work that i previously mentioned this is a horror film so it was really interesting to see what he would do with this movie

so whats the story chris played by daniel kaluuya goes on a trip with his girlfriend rose to meet her parents only thing is he is black and her parents are from a rural suburb and hes worried they wont care for them being in an interracial relationship at first everything seems okay the parents welcome chris in open arms however the longer they are at this meet the parents trip things become stranger and stranger as the parents gradually begin acting more sinister and hostile and every person that works at this house is black further adding to the creepiness of this whole situation

lets talk about the dialogue in this movie every single word that is said has some sort of meaning and commentary behind it if you watch the trailers youll see the dad using stereotypical black slang and accents when speaking to chris in an effort to relate to him every one is trying insanely hard to prove that they arent racist and many other things that make the viewer feel more uneasy the more they talk

the good thing is the subtext in this movie isnt completely reliant on dialogue the tvs look very much like the old style ones from the s the architecture of the house is colonial style like a plantation home and so much detail put in this movie that its insane you really get the feeling that jordan peele put a lot of effort and care into crafting this insane horrific world

also the pacing is very well done it starts off fairly relaxed not boring just relaxed then the further the movie goes along the more intense it gets the film lulls you in such a way that you dont even notice how drastically the tone changes over time until the movie is over and you realize youve been on the edge of your seat for over  minutes

despite the film being an extremely intense experience jordan peele does manage to sprinkle in some of his special brand of humor when the tension needs to ease up at times there were times when i would be scared out of my mind and then in the very next scene id be rolling in my seat laughing

you might take a look at this and think if youre a white person man i dont wanna watch this movie i dont wanna feel like some monster simply cause im white and to that i say get over yourself just because some white people suck doesnt automatically mean you do with that being said this movie takes a subject that can be very divisive and uses carefully crafted suspense blended with humor to bring the viewer in who may have an entirely different background from the main character as far as race relations go and generate sympathy for problems one may not have to deal with on a regular basis me personally im a white man from a rural southern suburb in a predominantly white town and unfortunately i have encountered many people with racist attitudes in my lifetime and yet i didnt feel attacked for my background or anything like that

while i did mention everything having a purpose and extreme attention to detail there are certain parts that while scary at the time dont really have a lasting impact on the story as a whole the thing is though this is something you dont realize until youre in the car on your way home and you think to yourself wait a second really thats my only knock about this movie the story is intriguing the dialogue and scenery are rich with social commentary its well paced just certain things dont really pay off as well as they could from time to time go see this movie if you consider yourself a horror fan you owe it to yourself to see this movie especially since good horror is in such short supply recently

441,441," jordan peeles first feature film offers a worryingly bleak reflection of race relations segregation and stereotyping in what will undoubtedly be one of s most troubling and terrifying films a psychological thriller dressed up as classic horror the sense of impending doom created right from the off  with an african american man walking through a white suburban neighborhood at night  leaves you with a sense of dread but also numbness and to an extent helpless voyeurism

though preposterous at times the twists and turns taken and sometimes alluded to but then swiftly negated do leave you guessing as to a potential solution to the many problems presented to both our main character chris brilliantly played by daniel kaluuya and best friend rod lil rel howery both of whom appear to represent specific  yet broad  archetypes of modern day black men in america the overall eeriness and gloom of peeles film is sometimes  intentionally undercut by the voices of certain characters for comedic effect yet this could be seen as another very real world commentary on the rubbishing of institutionalized racism which is still so prevalent in modern day society whilst not perfect get out is a bold daring and unflinching portrait of the st century racial landscape",negative,1

is it all that superior then personally i think weve seen better recently in films such as the witch and it follows but theres no denying that its a cut above the rest its certainly far more intelligent than most films nowadays which the academy miraculously realised after awarding it an oscar for best original screenplay last night it follows black british star daniel kaluuya as he goes to meet his white girlfriends parents at their large middleclass home everything seems fine a first but gradually things start to take a sinister turn as some very white guests arrive and seem to almost close in on our black hero to say anything else would be to ruin the terrific surprises in store i went in knowing almost nothing about the plot and was certainly all the better for it

get out takes a simple horror movie premise and turns it into a thoughtful and scarily plausible satire about racism whats nice is that it doesnt shove it down our throats in a hamfisted way like say mother which i loved i must say but theres stuff for keener viewers to dig in to it never patronises its audience and is always interested in building up a sense of paranoia and suspense around a likable protagonist who we can all root for it also manages to provide an exciting third act which manages to satisfy and thrill in equal measure

its difficult to believe that this is jordan peeles debut film the technical competence is pretty outstanding although he has had plenty of experience starring in film and tv before so he mustve learned something about being behind the camera whilst being in front of it he shows great flair and vision behind the camera always remaining focused and expertly building tension where most directors would go in for the heavyhanded approach peele uses subtlety and restraint even the barmy revelation is presented with such confidence that you dont doubt the logic for a second

get out might not be the groundbreaking classic you were hoping for but its certainly a fine horror film with enough comedy to comfortably cleanse your pallet despite always having its tongue in cheek it carries an important message about liberal racism and does an excellent job at making the audience feel what its like to be a black man in modern america the ending perhaps couldve been less predictable and convenient but get out offers plenty of hidden riches in repeated viewings",positive,9
444,444," i dont know why people thought this movie was going to be racist its a great movie jordan peele has crafted a movie so complexly amazing that it kept me on the edge of my sit the whole time it keeps you guessing throughout the movie of what is going to happen next and it might prove you wrong it definitely gets  stars or

this is not a cheap spoof movie

this movie is unique unlike most horror movies nowadays there is suspense mystery violence and thought compelling moments

it is legitimately scary while facing cultural issues in america today

you wont find any clich√© ghosts or haunted objects in this movie

instead you will get an enjoyable experience of trying to figure out what is really going on and who is who they say they are

plot: rose armitage  allison williams takes her boyfriend chris washington daniel kaluuya for a weekend her home all things slowly starts to go haywire for chris as he meets roses family

coming to the actors everything was great although daniel seemed a bit meh in a starting scenes but till the end he was at his best he truely deserved a nominations this year marcus handerson in his small role was effective so all the actors

get out has a rather slow pacing to start with as the story develops and the stage is set the racial topic is brought up a little to often to be comfortable but soon the reason for these strange encounters become apparent the story is thrilling and there is quite a bit of mystery in the film the ending is unnerving and unexpected the audience were very engaged with the film gasps and applause were quite frequent towards the ending climax it is an enjoyable thriller

457,457, i surprisingly liked this movie a lot more than i thought i would i knew from the clips and trailers i have seen that it was going to be well done and well acted and it was especially from daniel kaluuya superb acting even a lot of the smaller characters had certain moments where they shined it won the best screenplay award so i had that in mind while watching and i have to agree it was great the story grabs you from the start kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what the heck is going on but dont get me wrong its not action packed its a slow burn mind game and it was pretty fun trying to figure it all out dont watch clips or trailers it was nice going in not knowing much it was rated r because the story needed it to be not just because it wanted to be which i always appreciate the soundtrack was pretty cool but not that unique for this type of movie the directing was pretty great and the story was told very well you may be asking yourself why is chris surprised he liked it is it cause its about black people made by black people and hes racist and doesnt think black people can make good movies uh no ha thats what the social justice warriors want you to think which is exactly why i was surprised i liked it i feel like the oscars and lots of the media praised this movie so much and acted like it was the best movie of our generation and acted like it was so important for black people it made me think it was going to be filled with political and racist preaching but i watched it with an open mind and it wasnt like that i know it had metaphors and other things throughout but it wasnt in your face or preachy it was just a good thriller that you can either take at face value and enjoy or you can think really deep about and get social issues it lets you have that choice thats what surprised me and im glad so if you want a good thriller with twists and what the hecks or if youre racist against white people and want to see them get it get out is the film for you,positive,10
458,458," for the vast majority of this movie you will feel like  what the hell is this extremely racist crap literally every conversation throughout the movie has a classic racist clich√© vibe this movie is extremely derogatory towards black people i would assume there were many easily triggered people who walked out of the theater on premiere

apart from the insane display of racism the suspense was pretty decent not too much violence just tense atmosphere overall the movie is just fine and has a very original story have not seen anything quite like this just the execution could have been much better the ending is definitely extremely surprising seeing how racist the whole premise of this movie was

an interesting movie worth watching just because it is different and has an interesting outcome which was completely anticlich√©

465,465," pros: the acting in get out was phenomenal the best acting ive seen in this decade so far the genuine fear the main character had was chilling and the insanity that every other character played was impeccable the acting in my opinion is what carried the film most of the other parts of what makes a film worth watching were very ok the tension in the movie was good this portion couldve been much worse but it had a very unique style to it when you watch as many horror movies as i have you anticipate a certain style of rising action but this film came at it from a different perspective it wasnt my style but i could understand and appreciate it from a very technical level

cons: with any horror movie there will be some cons the ending in get out felt very unfinished to me it felt like the director couldnt come up with an ending as good as the rest of the film so instead he settled for this very mediocre finale but when you put that all aside there was one flaw that bothered me more than the rest get out was marketed as a big horror film or the most intense horror of  and these statements frustrated me because after watching the film it was quite obviously not a horror film more or less a psychological thriller i went in to this movie expecting one thing and preparing myself for that thing but in turn it delivered a completely different message was the movie good  yes but these negatives just stuck out like a sore thumb

469,469," the movie does a great job of subtly portraying some of the everyday stereotypes faced by the africanamerican community  from being asked to produce an id in the middle of the road to socalled liberal whites going out of their way to mention that they loved tiger woods and had voted for obama

what worked for me was that there was no banal supernatural element to bring in the horror component but something more realistic from our daytoday lives

 potential spoilers ahead 

the ending was pathetic though  it seemed that the scriptwriters ran out of ideas a happy ending is okay if executed properly but random coincidences no it would have been a fitting end to a horrorthriller if the police officer from before had arrived on the scene to arrest our hero whos fingerprints were on the handgun with the doublefaced girlfriend aptly playing the role of the victim

not long after chris arrives at roses parents house matters begin to get weird mr and mrs armitages affable behaviour a little too perfect while their home help maid georgina betty gabriel and groundsman walter marcus henderson act in a manner that can best be described as freakin bizarre a party for friends and family introduces more strange characters into the mix most of whom are politely racist something clearly isnt right about this picture but the viewer is wisely kept as much in the dark as chris while director jordan peele exhausts all of the possible paranoiaconspiracy angles all the strings are pulled together in the final act in which peele reveals the outlandish truth going for tension and scares with just a little gore for good measure

as a caucasian i guess i could take offence at the films portrayal of white folk who with no exception are evil bastards who covet the physically superior body of the african american instead i just found the whole crazy notion too absurd to take seriously",positive,8
472,472," get out focuses on a black man named chris while he travels with his girlfriend to meet her very nice but very suspicious parents after chris is introduced to the house he sees some disturbing imagery and weird acts that make him think something more darker is present but what exactly first off everybody in the movie is great this film also offers some astounding visual horror i didnt expect this to be a comedy but when you get the comedy it really pays off

get out actually touches some of the social issues that are in our world such as racism and it does it in a very smart way the soundtrack is also pretty great and works very well with what is going on in the movie this isnt a flaw but there are some scenes that were scary but it didnt really make any sense but fortunately the big twist explains why that weird thing happened i wont spoil it but the twist is very satisfying and is very unsettling to even think about

in the end get out was a very intense but also in a sort of sense serious with things that happen in our community and excellently blends horror comedy and social commentary in one original and creative film a or ",positive,8
473,473," this is hands down the first masterpiece of  it is definitely not a masterpiece of horror because it isnt a horror movie it is a thriller with bits of brilliant comedy infused in this film has a very important message on race and it really speaks on race as it is still a very serious problem in america but beyond the very relevant themes how is it as a movie it is flawless if you are looking for a great thriller this is the film for you the performances are all around incredible but the most impressive aspect hands down is jordan peeles writing and direction his vision is very well realized and its obvious that the studio really didnt give him much interference which is a very good thing because his vision was the best seeing how serious he took this project really makes me excited to see what he can do in the future i wont spoil anything but the ending and the twist is pure perfection i loved every moment of this film and although it might not be as scary as i had hoped thats not really the point in my opinion and in the end

475,475," have seen this much acclaimed flick i still dont know what to think about it it clocks in over  minutes and its all about situations and talking and that should be boring for a horror but somehow i kept watching to see what its all about and i agree halfway you get it its all clear what this is about and the opening sequence do explains itself throughout the flick

and the opening sequence is so really well done even as it doesnt gave any blood still it gives you the creeps the sound and the prowler it all works

but it really asks a lot of the viewer to sit throughout this flick it has awkward moments and you really do get into characterization that you want to know how this flick will ends i cant spoil but its really well written because one moment i couldnt see coming concerning the daughter

is it worth seeing well if you want to see a slasher or a nasty flick forget it its pure survival midst a strange family the story did remind me of faceless  somehow only for horror buffs who dig a lot of conversation and can wait until the last reel to see the bloody stuff

gore  nudity  effects  story  comedy ",positive,8
476,476," made an account just to rate this movie and if you ask why i rated it  it is because of the following reasons no spoilers:

 ive read the brief description thought it was just a racism movement movie was really making my mind if i should watch this after it i just cant look at other horror moviesthrillers without comparing it to this masterpiece  acting actors fit perfectly with roles every single one of them it is just amazing  the story was well executed perfectly it follows the viewers line of thinking and not some hey lets explore this because were original like that story like in  of the todays horror movies  not a single jumpscare but some scenes boy will they keep you on your toes the quality i always look in a horror movie if you jumpscare me go away if you set the mood so tight and so right its perfect a perfect horror movie  again the story its just too good and the actors fit them so well it is not even funny so hard to describe it without spoiling anything but guys its worth the mins trust me

oh and theres a funny black dude like always good guy",positive,9
477,477," i went to see this film knowing nothing about it not even its genre i was given some clues during the trailers before the movie first i was forced to enter a room with a young girl looking out the window only to turn around and suddenly reveal to my shock and horror the she was a very loud cgi monster then i was made to watch some kids go into a dark scary room filled with water which was suddenly and very loudly a clowndolls swimming pool or something

and so i discovered get out is a horror movie get out however does not follow a formulaic build up of jump scares and rehashed imagery to create its tension and tone it does this through meshing flawless cinematography with brilliant acting music lighting and script furthermore the movie has plenty of commentary on the modern and historical faces of racism which it explores masterfully whilst never insulting its audience by being too brash

every shot in this movie feels carefully crafted to create tension and unease from the single uncut shot of the opening scene to the unnerving choice of extreme close ups during dialogue so often the choice of shot subverts what you would expect for the scene characters being warmly greeted by family is shown in a long shot giving a sense of detachment and that feeling of being watched you are also as acutely aware of what is not in frame during the film as you are of what is in frame and this only adds to the ever mounting suspense combine all this with an eerie soundtrack if a little clich√© and you have a film that feels organically creepy and not manufactured

furthermore the film has genuine moments of comedy which is unsurprising given its directors background but the occasional comedic shifts in the movies tone never felt clunky well rounded and well fleshed out characters meant that the humour felt like it came naturally to scenes

to go with the meticulous directing is a strong script the film reveals information at an appropriate rate the pacing is never tedious or rushed and most importantly character motivations never feel inauthentic importantly there wasnt that im going to stop escaping to go open that door where the eerie music is coming from i hope that loud jumpy stabby thing thats been chasing me isnt there scene that pulls you from the movie

this film is as intelligent as it is gripping it will disturb and entertain you whilst viewing it it will provoke thought during and after it will continue to grow on you long after watching jordan peele has put together a wholly original film that feels fresh authentic and most of all meticulously crafted i thought hard about what rating to give it and ended up figuring if i dont give a film this unique and this well made a  then whats the point in having a score go up to  do yourself and those interested in original and well made cinema a favour by supporting this film and seeing it on the big screen",positive,8
480,480," i saw this one recently and enjoyed it

get out is a very clever horror film that also contains some thoughtprovoking subtext about race relations just below its surface it also has a number of good laughs in it so its bending a few genre conventions here methinks its an entertaining genre film but it also has some social commentary in it too so it works on more than one level

all the performances are strong but daniel kaluuya is particularly effective playing a boyfriend caught up in a scenario that isnt entirely what it appears to be on the surface catherine keener is also very memorable in this one playing a mom who might be more than just a typical nurturing mother but theres more than one memorable performance in this movie the entire cast is very good

anyway thumbs up from me get out is one of the best horror flicks ive seen this year and its definitely worth checking out this is jordan peeles first film as a director and it will be interesting to see what he does next",positive,8
481,481," wow just wow about time hollywood had the balls to put out something like this bravo this is the kind of movie you want to watch again right after watching it because of how new and innovating it is this isnt the same recycled horror film youve seen a million times before and that is why this film performed as well as it did im guessing you know the plot already a white girl takes her black boyfriend to meet her parents and the boyfriend notices an above average amount of racial awareness and overall creepiness going on with her family and ill leave it at that do yourself a favor and watch this movie without knowing anything else about it i cant wait to watch it again i think this film does an outstanding job of letting film goers feel what a black person or any minority feels like in the united states at times you already know this is getting a ten out of ten from me

484,484," jordan peele of key and peele fame kicks off his directorial career with a genreswapping film that depicts a young black mans illfated journey to his white girlfriends parents house there he finds that all is not as it should be and that his prospective inlaws may not be as normal as they appear to be

the atmosphere of get out is one of the very best you can create in a film spinechillingly creepy at times with foreshadowing and acting that works better than any jump scare and at other times raucously enjoyable witty and entertaining it succeeds across all fronts daniel kaluuya makes for a relatable and likable protagonist that the audience can root for whilst lil rel howery as his erstwhile and foulmouthed friend is huge fun and one of the standout comedy characters in recent years the parents played noteperfectly by catherine keener and bradley whitford represent a rampedup version of the socalled west wing liberals the type of people who purport to be progressive and welcoming but inadvertently make black people uncomfortable with racial stereotypes and microaggressions

the film ends up being one of the best cinematic examples of presenting race in a long time perfectly capturing the zeitgeisty racial divide in modern america its depiction of the daily struggles faced by minorities is remarkable and one of the scariest aspects of the film is how plausible and true to life it all is up to a point the satire is delivered flawlessly and peele deserves all the plaudits he is receiving for the astounding firsttime effort he has made here combining his fresh razorsharp and highly witty script with the subtle yet  effective direction he has made a film that is not only one of the best satires of modern times but also an incredibly enjoyable horrorcomedy

it is not quite accurate to label get out a true horror film it is certainly scary mainly stemming from the experience kaluuyas chris has to go through which transports the viewer into his shoes and leaves us on edge throughout the buildup however if you go in expecting a halloweenready horror film that will rival the horror classics you will inevitably be disappointed it is more of a horrorstyle thriller with its dynamic plot taking the audience on a twisty and unpredictable journey that lets the viewer piece it together whilst going along

overall get out is probably the best film of the first few months of  being fresh innovative thrilling scary and sharply scripted jordan peeles debut is promising and its an important film for the issue of race ",negative,1

488,488," wife wanted to go see it and im always down to see a horror flick in theater so i said heck yes lets go i went in expecting racial parents terrorize black boyfriend ok could be fun turns out there is a much more interesting and even a scifi premise going on here that really had me enjoying this movie quite a bit by the end the first half does a good job of setting the stage and gets you thinking ok what the hell is going on here which is exactly what the main actor is going through  well played

as for the racial bias against whites  as a white male im not feeling it on this if you watch the movie to completion this goes way beyond mere racism and more into sick scifi that said the build up to this point is full of comedic racial tension that all but the most grumpy white and black folks can laugh at this makes the usual thriller build up that more entertaining

overall for the genre this was excellent and easily worth a theater outing ",positive,8
489,489," get out is a wellbalanced blend of horror and comedy while it is consistently eerie intriguing and suspenseful the comedy manages to compliment the tone which is hard to achieve for example the comic relief character tsa agent rod is actually funny and a stand out which is uncommon but it should be noted that every actor in this film is stellar particularly daniel kaluuya director jordan peele key  peele and keanu displays a strong influence from classic horrorslasher films but shows enough originality black brainwashing the sunken place to stand out from other horror directors he achieves this by subverting the horror genre having a black male as the lead in peril instead of a virginal babysitter

the theme of racism is strong and ballsy peeles tactic of having white middleclass liberals you as the villain the movie reflects back on the audience to chilling results like black mirror only much better the film remains accessible throughout despite the heavy in your face race theme ‚Äì i felt the metaphor lacked subtlety which was a small issue the ending was good if a little too small in scale hot fuzz was better at this and the twist was surprising and had a strong buildup get the keys the film was let down by not having a big scarefactor ‚Äì this was more creepy than scary and longtime horror fans might be disappointed with the slightly unnecessary jump scare cues i would describe get out as creative and engaging and awesome to watch with a cinema audience i cant remember an ordinary packed screening room clapping before",negative,1

there are some very effective creepy parts there are some hilarious parts  some awkward humor as white residents of the neighborhood say racist things while explaining to the protagonist how theyre not racist and some just funny parts with the comic relief character

things its not:

really serious

a masterpiece

a horror movie

racist as some reviewers try to claim",negative,1
491,491," this review of get out is spoiler free

 

as it happens there is indeed no perfect time for jordan peeles directorial debut to come out in a year when weve already had hidden figures loving fences and the best picture winning moonlight taking their challenging turns in showing how racist america used to be peele whos also lived with racism decided to input all them racist thoughts into the incredible get out the social commentary is cleverly crafted too not only adapting racism to the st century but also giving hilarious moments especially from the scene stealingly funny lilrel howery who thinks that chris is being hypnotized into a sex slave cleverly changing the narrative but also giving laugh out loud moments the films design is purely intended to lift the fa√ßade of postracial america and showcase the ugliness still lying beneath the astounding thing about it is he not only sharply manages to craft the film with racism but crafting it so that he even made a hugely entertaining thriller with horror elements

still its not an easy watch for the modern audience given that a young africanamerican man as a target for this goes without saying horrific but incredibly well the young africanamerican man here is chris washington daniel kaluuya whos in a relationship with a young caucasian woman rose allison williams hes particularly nervous having never met her parents he gets the idea that theyre going to hate him while on the other hand trying to make him a slave when they arrive her parents immediately take a liking to him they become instant friends this is when the film changes pace chris notices that arent quite right with this average american family estate he takes a certain notice to the africanamerican janitor and housemaid helping on the house  perhaps hinting that this family are stuck in the past

peele makes us wait for even an immediate thrill to take place to perhaps give us a jolt but its as while before this happens yet when it does the goosebumps are relentless its only a second but its effective given that the tension slowly rises and it keeps our fixed gaze on the screen keeps the audience on edge as if tied to the seat wondering whats going to happen next

what follows are relentless thrills and jump scares as chris is scared lifeless hes hypnotized to quit smoking which takes to bigger effect later and hes left to a moment when he has to escape after being brutally warned to get out by a fellow africanamerican in posttrance state peele amps the tension up to  here giving no boundaries as to how far hell take this the secret reveal takes a turn for the worse when chris finds that his girlfriend isnt who she says she is ‚Äì adding to the rising shock factor

slowly turning into an escape movie when chris is hypnotized he has to escape from a celllike room it has moments of stepford wives and there is a deer antler impalement reference from silent night deadly night this confident debut is never boring its hilarious its thrilling and its original peele has come a long way since the altruistic comedy standings of key and peele and last years muddled keanu but here his dark side shows its strength get out is the cleverest horror weve had in ages and its just what we need

verdict: a thrillingly confident debut by peele a masterfully constructed plot carefully matching horror with hilarious social commentary with natural seatedge suspense",negative,1
494,494," is it possible for a movie to be both stupid and smart both blunt and subtle generally speaking no but in the case of a film like get out the answer is very much yes get out is a movie of contradictions as opposed to being a weakness the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them

this is the directorial debut of jordan peele better known as the second half of the comedy duo key  peele a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series last year it was the comedy keanu and now we have peele by himself behind the camera for a directorial debut he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling also he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: its not necessarily what you see that scares you but what lurks just out of sight

further if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy without giving anything away there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie nevertheless due to the way that the movie is woven together they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension

if all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst clich√©s of the genre eg annoying characters doing truly stupid things then you should enjoy yourself just fine however there is so much more to uncover within this movie

you might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie yet no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist the movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism instead it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and by doing so many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice

on closer inspection this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing just as with prejudice if you take this film at face value then youve missed the subtle undertones that give life depth peele retells a moral told many times before yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting

peeles directing career is off to a very strong start im exciting to see what he makes next",positive,8
495,495," i really regret the ¬£ i spent to watch this doublyracist tripe its not a horror movie but its not a thriller either it feels more like a drama film youd find latenight on channel  the film is racist to both black and white people i can only imagine a black person wrote the movie as there would rightly be an uproar if it was a white person saying to black people hey this is how you talk this is how you dress your skin colour is important and no youre not people who give handshakes only fist pumps i dislike this movie so much that like so many other star reviews here i cant even summon the energy to write about it after i watched the movie i saw the trailer for it the trailer is the movie every important scene is in the trailer youre better off just watching the trailer and reading the plot on wikipedia save your energy and dont contribute any money towards a racist project

502,502," let me get one thing clear my expectations were high when i sat down to watch this film everything id heard everything id read suggested i was in for a cinematic masterpiece

that is not the case whatsoever the script is contrived im sorry but the suggestion of racism within the female leads family was introduced with all the subtly of a brick through a window the main characters unlikable the set up pace too slow and the very concept of what was going to happen so ridiculous it betrayed any sense of commentary or message the film was trying to convey

ill accept this review isnt terribly insightful but in truth i dont want to waste any more time on it than i already have that said i feel compelled to warn people off from the ott hype with this seemingly just another fashionable movie like drive which was another one that i found massively disappointing

im afraid the writerdirector isnt as clever as he thinks and this film is in no way as good as everyone thinks i should have realised that from the opening scene where the man onscreen basically talks through what hes doing  something so unrealistic and ridiculous it took my breath away

ive given this a very generous  star rating although thats mostly because some of the cinematography was fairly decent",positive,7
503,503," i wont even go into minor details how a white person can feel while watching this movie its entirely rasistic toward any other color of skin but black starting from cliche bad white cop classic white family who hate black people  but wait a minute want to be like them because black people are superior its stated in the movie more than once etc the second bad thing is the acting i could cope with one bad actor maybe  or  but the whole crew cant express one single emotion right the only solid actor was lilrel howery and maybe just maybe bradley whitford lilrel had a classic tvtrope role of a classic black guy in the movie that shouldnt been racist i could go on and on about this awful movie but i will stop right now and just tell people who dont like engaging in current politic situation being on just one side and one side only to leave this movie to those kind of people

504,504," i just hate it when every horrorthriller movie takes out intelligence from victims and this movie is very satisfying on this matter chris is likable relatable intelligent and capable which automatically makes him stand out as a protagonist in this genre with underlined political message to think about the movie takes you on a joyful thriller ride filled with suspense theres just enough of humor to chuckle through it and its well timed to not take away from creepiness of the situation chris impressions of things developing are in line with audience which keeps movie on topic every minute of it and doesnt fall behind in keeping it suspenseful

ive seen lots of people complaining how message about white people playing on privilege is too much in your face and i beg to differ theres plentiful screenplay lines that affect chris realistically and that are happening out there in the real world anyone who would find characters domination through this story insulting needs to be reminded that that table turns story to story and this story was this guys turn while its good to think about that topic thrill is guiding the movie and is written for the genre and screened incredibly well  if youd allow that your ego is so strong to prevent you enjoying such a great cinematic piece then problem is not the movie or that message",positive,8
505,505," i have just finished watching this film and i absolutely loved it the story moves at a brisk enough pace that i never felt bored theres enough intrigue to keep you interested and the blend of suspense and then lighter comical moments are done just right its very well acted and the lead characterplayed by daniel kaluuya is brilliant also i have to say i found his best friend rodplayed by lil tel howery hilarious he had me in stitchesso often these films that are hyped up are disappointing but this is the exceptioni would definitely recommend iti gave this film the full ten out of ten as there is literally nothing bad i can say about it

506,506," get out is an instant classic turning an everyday awkward concern into a plot to an intense horror masterpiece that makes you feel for its main character youd think while watching whoever made this is a film veteran who can really create atmosphere and mood perfectly but jordan peele is a first time director and you can really tell he put a ton of effort and inspiration from other horror flicks into this one the climax is satisfying and crazy and it leaves you surprised and afraid when all the puzzle pieces get put together and chris needs to well get out

daniel kaluuya makes for a welldone protagonist and every antagonist is creepy twisted and well portrayed in this underlooked gem of excitement

511,511," get out is a great horror film for horror movie fans there are unexpected laughs in the film that go with the subject of racism in america and sex slaving between the main guy chris and his best friend rod all the performances are really good especially for the newcomer daniel kaluuya who plays the main guy chris who goes to his girlfriends familys house estate to see her parents who are greatly performed by bradley whitford and catherine keener this does deliver a couple of jump scares but it focuses on the psychological side of the film which i think its a good thing that happens in the film

i think that this film is great for all horror movie fans all out there from all around the world

514,514," many people have said that this movie is racist towards white people and so for that reason i went into this experience with a dose of skepticism after seeing the movie i will say that while there is racial tension it was never to the point of labeling any race as racist but in fact showing the awkward nature of racial tensions and the comedy that can come about from it jordan peele used it in a way that was reminiscent of british humour which is something i really enjoyed on top of that we have some first rate suspense and a strong sense of anticipation the ending was a bit of a let down but it didnt derail what was a throwback to classic horror with some humour thrown in there for good measure

515,515," i am a huge fan of jordan peele i loved key and peele and loved that the duo stepped into making a film with a pretty good comedy in keanu all that said i had some strong reservations about jordan peele stepping out of his comedic element and into a horror especially one that is psychological i didnt know what to make of the trailer i was thinking that this had to be one of those horrors with humor i just couldnt see peele stepping that far out of his comfort zone while i feel this film gets overrated by the masses its quite a successful venture for peele

the film follows a black man named chris and his white girlfriend rose rose decides to introduce her boyfriend to her family while everything seems peachy at first it soon becomes obvious to chris that something is way wrong the black workers in the house act so weird and reserved and the extended family and friends of rose are far too intrigued by chris and the color of his skin while i wont divulge any deeper into the plot id say this was a fairly satisfying film its an interesting effort by peele that has some real world relativism

the scares are predictable and come in moments that are exactly where we expect them to be the film still keeps you engaged and entertained and coming up with theories of your own as you go along for the right the film is kind of predictable at least the main arc of what is actually going on with the family that really doesnt take away from what is given there is a fair bit of nice imagery which goes to show some of the creativity peele had for this the social and racial aspect of this film cant be denied its a bit of a social commentary

this will probably be a breakout role for kaluuya hes come a long way from that episode of black mirror the film received higher praise than i think it deserves but it does a good job at being a thrilling and engaging film i am very optimistic about seeing whatever jordan peele decides to do next because i am certain now that he is very capable of going outside the comedy box

",negative,1
517,517," finally finally a good horror movie it is far between but get out can warmly recommended if you like both good movie and an eerie and thrilling experience

i will not divulge any of the action read minimum possible about the plot before you see it but what i can write is that the film has an action that builds long plot up and giving the audience hints along the way the film also features traditional elements of horror which causes one to sprinkle but some of the best of the film is the combination unconventional action in combination with good horror effects

the actors were unknown to me at the forefront but the convicts to the fullest enjoy also the raw end for this is a film that delivers until it is finished

this is a warm recommendation

519,519," get out is an all new horror film directed by yes the comedian jordan peele it was very interesting to see that a comedian had directed this horror movie and executed it so well surprisingly i wasnt necessarily scared i was more in shock if anything this movie seems to poignantly point out horror themed references but it fails to truly make them remarkable it seems like at first that it doesnt take itself seriously but some scenes just get more and more peculiar while its a weird movie i can agree its easily one of the best thrillers you can see this year it definitely has an idea that strikes out at you in expectations but i feel its failed to truly stand as a horror film is this a recommended movie yes for what it is but would i classify this as a horror film no i would not the acting was great and the story was soso but in all it definitely is worth the watch

520,520, jordan peeles directorial debut is a smash hit a great take on the horror genre with enough comic satiric material to keep you on the edge of you seat both in terror and abdominal pain the movie tackles the always complex and divisive theme of race but it passes the test with flying colors not coming off offensive by any standards all politics aside the movie is a pure joy to watch from the simplicity of its shot design to the fool proof way it is directed the movie is truly remarkable considering that this is jordan peeles first movie having said this i do think the movie has been garnering exaggerated praise the movie is a really fun watch but thats about it for a movie with a  as of today on rt i found it rather dull and lacking in substance what it lacks in substance it more than makes up for in style the movie creates situations that should be frightening but my reaction is laughter and thats directly the focal point of the man behind the camera and his humor regardless the movie builds up to an impressive third act where the funny just leaves and here is where the horror in this movie truly shines regardless if i had to compare this movie with a cure for wellness both original horror movies i would tell you the following if you love film composition and direction see a cure for wellness but if you wanna see a horror film with your friends and just have a good time well get out is your flick,positive,7
521,521," get out was a wonderful watch  i found myself alternating between laughing in shock and disbelief laughing in genuine goodnatured joy and of course as it is a horror finding myself deeply afraid for the protagonists wellbeing

i wouldnt say get out revolves around a twist  because a twist implies something unexpected and while it isnt entirely expected the script did an amazing job of laying all the pieces out for you to realize what was going on on your own time that said the ending is intensely satisfying it has all the hallmarks of a great horror film for me the protagonist is extremely likable theres gore and anticipation and characters with disgusting but realistic motivations and the bad ends for each individual who has one feel completely justified and necessary

growing up in a very diverse metropolitan area in the us and seeing how different the suburbs can be i found it a plausibleyetmorallyunthinkable extension of reallife unpleasant racial dynamics for the skeptics among us brushing up on your history of medical atrocities will give the film some muchneeded context  and despite the very heavy themes throughout the main characters attitude and simple ability to keep going in a horrible situation as well as the comedic elements keep get out from being unwatchably dark highly recommended",negative,3
522,522," i try to have an open mind about things i dont like movies that portray any race as bad people yes throughout history groups of people have committed horrible atrocities against other peoples but as a rule unless its in the context of historical storytelling i prefer to steer clear that being said i heard about the hype that this movies was great and decided to check it out the only thing this movie made me think about was if this movie was remade with the races reversed then how would it be received

523,523," hey this movie have actually done it and i cant think of anything that did it before this one  it managed to be totally supportive on blackwhite racial equality by being equally insulting to both white and black people really if someone told me the whole story of this before i watched it i would react exactly like the cops in this movie

seriously this flick looks like it was filmed with just a draft of a script and i wouldnt even call it a horror it is unoriginal and rather ridiculous than frightening dont waste your time  its the most valuable resource you have

ps: it honestly sickens me to even think that but i have a slight notion it has such high ratings because of the racial angle of the production which is sad actually because i dont believe people of minorities make worse anything as a rule which means their works need not to be given any undeserved praise  that is not what equality means people that is actually a bad harmful idea  if say a movie is praised as good  or even best like moonlight  just because of some misguided parity sense  in other words just because it was made mostly by minority members and apart from that it is like moonlight or idamediocre at best then it harms the minority more than it helps it its simple  if you do anything and you are objectively not best in it or you suck at it even but everyone around you tells you that what you do is awesome then you dont have any incentive to try harder and be better

it can even be a source of deep frustration as you can sometimes tell that youre getting undeserved praise like from a overbearing parent and deep down you know it is not sincere and something else entirely stands behind it like some politics that dont concern you personally as a creator

if my work was praised no matter how bad it was just because of my color beliefs or ethnicity i know i would not be happy or satisfied with it also such practices make room for unethical creators who will see that picking up a specific set of topics for their works will automatically allow them to get ahead of any competition just because the topic is politically desired to be shown in certain context rather than the quality of the work itself its damaging and demoralizing",negative,1
524,524," i heard good things about this film but beyond that i really didnt know much about it  comedy or horror or a mix that was about it what i got reminded me of black mirror in terms of its tone and dark but yet slightly comic material the plot starts with an oddly racial situation where the family are well meaning and accepting but at the same time not in a way where the blackwhite divide is not clearly present in some way from here it starts to add gentle shifts of tension and a creeping sense of unease and dread across the plot it is this element that works best because it provides engagement leading to a reasonably short period of reveal and resolution  this final section working best because of the investment in the mystery side

the film is well paced to do this and the plot is satisfying in the way that it uses race but at the same time stands on its own feet without it being a theme if you dont see it or want it first and foremost it is a horror and it is an effective one the cast work really well from top to bottom kaluuya leads the film well and is convincing in all his moments williams is good and holds her own alongside whitford root and keener howery gets his performance just right  he could easily have been too much comedy but he hits his marks importantly

get out is a smartly created horrorchiller where race is used as a strong foundation but not in a way that the film forgets what it is trying to do",positive,10
525,525," get out follows a young black man who heads to his white girlfriends parents home in an upscale bedroom community things are a bit off from the beginning but they become progressively weirder‚Äîand worse‚Äîas his visit unwinds

decried by the political right as racist and touted as a racialpolitical masterpiece by the left it seems to me that most people are forgetting that at the end of the day get out is a horror film and it earns its thrills amicably of course there are racial politics being commented on here‚Äîat times far too heavyhandedly so‚Äîbut one has to remember that peeles script is an exaggerated distortion as commentary on the current social climate around race as a topic its hyperbole at its finest

as a horror film get out is successful because it manages to generate tension and push buttons in all the right places it plays to audience expectations just about as much as it doesnt so there is both intrigue and the expected catharsis these films are known for delivered equal measure peele wears his influences on his sleeve here with the stepford wives novel and film being a chief template even down to the films primly manicured lawns in what is ostensibly anywhere connecticut usa

the offkilter atmosphere is strengthened by astute performances from all involved: daniel kaluuya is a sympathetic lead and allison williams though i found her profoundly annoying in the first two acts plays the finale much better catherine keener and bradley whitford play the white liberal country clubbers who voted for obama to a t but sublimate a perceptible weirdness that adds to the tension especially keener the performances from marcus henderson and betty gabriel are also noteworthy in their utter weirdness marked by odd expressions movements and gestures that throw the audience off over and over again i did find the final act and reveal as fun as it is a bit routine its remarkably playful and has some clever shifts but at the same time its nothing we havent seen before‚Äîthat said it is nonetheless nicely played

in the end get out is a legitimately fun atmospheric and suspenseful offering a large part of what allows the film to surprise its audience is its core commentary and observations on race and what peele has in essence done is inject that into a triedandtrue genre setup its wryly political as much as it is committed to maintaining its horror prerequisites ",positive,9
526,526," this is such a clever film not only does it have a thrilling unpredictable and often shocking plot but it also brilliantly interweaves the horrormystery element with fantastic comedy and strong social satire brilliantly directed by jordan peele from start to finish and featuring an entire cast of excellent performances get out is a hugely entertaining movie that you really wont be able to take your eyes away from

if theres one thing that really works about this film however its the story dont go into this expecting a typical horror movie because youll come out disappointed whilst peele brilliantly honours so many classic elements of the genre this is much closer to a mystery thriller than a bogstandard scarefest and although there are one or two fun jumpscares its the tension of the story thatll really get you hooked

with an immediately unsettling atmosphere get out is a riveting watch right from the start however what it does best is patiently build more and more tension and mystery into the plot as it moves along the opening act wont have you on the edge of your seat but it effectively establishes the strangely uneasy atmosphere of the big country house something that plays a big role in making the following two acts work so well

from then on its twists and turns galore as the film dives into thrilling and even shocking territory ill avoid all spoilers as always because you really dont want to miss the incredible reveals that happen again and again throughout the movie reveals that turn it from an unsettling thrillerhorror parody into something much darker and yet so ludicrous you could never see it coming

and thats where the comedy comes in as strong as the eerie atmosphere is throughout the movie the story would be lost if there wasnt a good sense of humour thrown in too as i said things do take a turn for the more preposterous in the latter stages but it works perfectly because the film always lets you know its not taking itself too seriously right from the start

but the great thing is that its not the sort of comedy that would make this a horrorcomedy whilst it definitely leans more towards enjoyment over scares the humour in get out is fantastically nuanced throughout never cheapening the nailbiting thrills of its atmosphere and story yet still making for some brilliant laughs

you do get a good bit of comic relief from time to time thanks to daniel kaluuyas effortless charisma as well as the hilarious supporting performance from lil rel howery but the best laughs in the movie come from the mix with the almost comically unsettling world of the upper middle class white people

and thats where the last spark of genius comes in jordan peeles screenplay is already thrilling and funny but what makes it even more impressive is its ingenious social satire although a little heavyhanded on the subject in the opening act the film eventually gets into its stride with an utterly hilarious series of jabs at the suspiciously sanitised world of upper middle class white people

with all of the actors playing along brilliantly to the extent where you get an insanely creepy village of the damned vibe from the white side of the cast theres so much fun to be had with the films satire of that side of society as well as awkward race relations that are brought up time and time again its a brilliantly clever touch and it adds so much enjoyment to the movie as a whole

finally we need to quickly talk about the performances and the directing the entire cast is fantastic throughout all playing their roles appropriately for both a horror movie and something a little more comical helping to glue peeles two genres together so effortlessly with particular standout performances from daniel kaluuya lil rel howery betty gabriel and stephen root

and then we come on to jordan peeles brilliant directing ive already talked about how perfectly unsettling and creepy this movie is from start to finish as well as its brilliant blend of humour satire and thrills but i also cant ignore how wellpaced and well established this film is with some excellent editing as well peeles fun loving yet unnerving style works an absolute treat throughout and thats the final reason that this film just comes together so well

overall i absolutely loved get out its a seriously creepy and unsettling film right the way through and one that will have you biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat right up to the end however its also much more than a brilliant thriller with amazing humour and social satire thrown into the story a whole host of amazing performances and stunning direction from jordan peele",positive,7
527,527," get out is a horrorthriller directed by the hilarious jordan peele the movie is centered around chris a young african american man and his caucasian girlfriend rose the couple have been dating for five months and the time to meet the parents has arrived in a very welldirected scene between chris and rose we learn that chris is reluctant to meet her parents  because as far as he knows they are unaware of his skin color when the couple arrive at the parents house chris is greeted warmly  too warmly its even eerie over the course of his visit chris becomes increasingly uncomfortable in this place i wont spoil anything but this movie becomes more and more unsettling with each scene

surprisingly this movie functions as a comedic satire a social drama and a horror movie jordan peele has found a way to send a message about modern racial prejudices while incorporating hilarious comedic relief throughout this movie doesnt take itself too seriously and thats a good thing however it sure does scare it scares you in a way that you werent expecting it toys with your emotions you feel anxious for chris safety you feel terrified of racism and you feel amused with how overthetop the entire movie is

get out takes plenty of risks it paints an incredibly unique picture of racism in america and thats probably the most horrifying thing of all",negative,3
528,528," jordan peeles get out is a new take on a classic story get out takes this approach to examine the state of racism in our so called postracism society from the very start of the film a sense of uneasiness is present in the main character chris this uneasiness is maintained and heightened as events unfold viewers are set into a cycle of uncertainty fear and momentary relief they are pressed with visceral feelings that accumulate as the story unfolds you really dont know what is going on until the final act of the film where the curtains fly open the misenscene of every scene is dramatically important we are given clues of the future from the very start of the film there are times where a seemingly meaningless joke has tremendous implications the deep web of foreshadowing can only be appreciated after subsequent viewings

of course a riveting story is important but so is the cinematography and sound peeles use of zooms extreme close ups high angles low angles create a collage of scenes that are laid out beautifully onscreen these techniques enhance the viewer experience and improves storytelling sounds are equally important the phenomenal score bounced between moments of silence and intense heart wrenching music the dialogue and acting are both very fluid and the script never stops impressing most importantly however is the use of dietetic sound for storytelling the main characters experience important moments of sound that impact their state of mind in the scene

overall the film leaves almost nothing to be desired it is a journey that ends on a very satisfying note",positive,5

531,531," the first  minutes to an hour had me sitting on the tip of my seat the movie gives you this very uncomfortable feeling you know something really bad is about to happen but you dont know what it keeps you on edge and thats great after the plot twist however my interest dwindled slightly

i really liked the main character  great performance by daniel kaluuya by the way  and its easy to sympathise with him maybe thats also because he seems to be one of the very few sane people in the movie youll find yourself rooting for him the other members of the cast also play their roles very well there isnt a bad actor or actress in this film the humour is quite well done the jokes are funny but also feel kind of awkward which is exactly what suits this movie the story is good definitely and absolutely original but im not sure how to feel about the plot twist it almost feels silly but i guess thats kind of the point

in summary this movie is intriguing and original and worth the watch",negative,2
532,532," i have never seen a better movie that depicts the insidious rather than overt nature of racism this movie is for all the white folks who think they arent racist there are so many layers to this movie: majority culture coercing the minds of the minority the annoyance of having to explain your identity to every white person around you the societal eyerolls when a black person goes missing the violent nature of a black man gaslighting at its finest sometimes the everyday occurrences that a person experiences is more painful than one traumatic event this movie perfectly depicts just that

and to all those that complain that this movie played the race card: this is like complaining that the pirates of the caribbean movie played the pirate card why isnt racism a legitimate theme in cinema oscars im looking at you i understand why some white folks dont like having a mirror held in front of them but that doesnt make those suffering from wellintentioned white people disappear looking away is culpability and watching this movie is one small step in the opposite direction and isnt that the whole point of art to open your eyes to make you feel doesnt the best kind of art make you feel uncomfortable and in that discomfort change your perspective this is a horror movie told through the eyes of a black man but unlike slasher films this horror comes from a very real place this is what i learned from watching this movie as a white woman so excuse my ignorance as i am not black i can never begin to understand how that feels ignorance is bliss which is a dangerous luxury that is not afforded to all",negative,1
533,533," you know we are in a postoscars movie slump when a satire horror like get out  can generate global praise for bravely cutting new ground in film the truth is: it does not what it does is satirise the political correctness of a white majority that expresses racial tolerance but harbours malice for those who are different set aside that message and you are left with a wellpaced well acted but predictable horror film that preys on white guilt and coloured fear

the storyline is clearcut and entirely consistent with the standard tropes of zombielike horrors cool black photographer chris washington daniel kaluuya and his gorgeous widesmiling girlfriend rose armitage allison williams have been dating seriously for a few months when rose arranges a weekend to meet the parents she insists that it is not worth mentioning that chris is a black dude as her neurosurgeon father dean and psychiatric hypnotherapist mother missy are so liberally nonracist that they would have voted for a third obama term driving onto the sprawling grounds of her parents home chris notices a black gardener with a weird smile who stares vacantly the camera cuts to chriss face and we know immediately what he is thinking after an effusively overfriendly greeting by the parents at the front doorstep chris sees a black housemaid with the same weirdly vacant stare after an awkwardly polite dinner where chris is subjected to the usual newboyfriend interrogation missy tricks him into being placed in a hypnotic state that renders him controllable by the tinkling of a spoon in a teacup from here on the story shows chris increasingly entrapped by the family until he realises his life is in danger and that he must get out

from the minute that chris sees the look on the gardeners face most of the script is laid bare if that does not sufficiently telegraph the narrative arc that lies ahead the dinner with the parents make the trap and its dangers obvious the story pivots on the plausibility of a tinkling teacup making chris comatose and the duplicity of his girlfriend as the collector of fine black human specimens for neurotransplant purposes but of course in the horror genre there are no boundaries for plausibility and no limits to the gory ways of ending someones life while the plots weirdness requires suspension of disbelief the casting and acting is excellent and delivers entertainment value for horror audiences money although words like original do not suit this film it is tightly directed and holds enough twisted surprises to keep viewers engaged as it cruises to its entertainingly bloodfilled climax

some of the overhyped publicity surrounding this film dwells more on its racial message than its merits as a horror film indeed some are even calling it a landmark in socially progressive film for this to pass any plausibility test we must be prepared to imagine that the most vocal middleclass supporters of racial equality in contemporary society are most likely the ones that subliminally at least harbour the most evil intentions towards coloured minorities this would be a regressive exploitation of a complex social issue that in this writers view is not what this film is about its just an entertaining horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire that is filling cinemas while we wait for the next round of oscar nominated movies",positive,8
534,534," despite the low ratings by white supremacists who obviously hate black people and cannot handle the black perspectivethis movie is goodthe acting is greatthe plot is engaging and i watched beginning to end edge of my seat im glad it got a high overall score some people can never get past a movie that sheds any white person in a bad light and a black person is the main characterif you can get past thatare emotionally mature and intelligent enough to enjoy a movie for what it is entertainmenti recommend get outit is original and will stay with you for a long time

535,535," sadly it is the most racist movie that i and probably anyone here have ever seen the whole movie is based on the concept of race differences only black people are presented as good and physically superior human beings while all the whites are jealous emotionless rich psychos who crave for blacks strength and superiority actually i could say much more about symbolism in this movie and disgusting insinuations but what ive just written is enough really it is even hard to believe that such movie was released i guess it had never been if the roles in the movie were reversed

536,536," white girl has a black boyfriend and they decide to spend a weekend away with her parents for the first time he is told that her parents are unaware she is dating a black guy and he feels uncomfortable about the pending visit

for me the portrayal of the girlfriend was a bit full on she was annoying and uncomfortable in the role maybe this was purposeful a hint at what was to come but i feel she was just not right for the part then i read her bio and find shes the daughter of prominent news anchor and things seem to make sense

i got all the racist jokes the irony of the ending scenes etc but there have been better movies that have dealt with race issues in the same way and there were no surprises in the movie itself you know whats going to happen its all a bit weak completely unrealistic and no real horror to be had there are periods of suspense and a bit of blood on occasion and i did like the hypnotism inclusion and the way it was woven into the plot the main guy must have been cast due to his eyes alone he looks like he being tortured while just reading a book the guy playing the father was ok again laid it on thick it was part of the plot to do so but it still made the movie almost a parody of itself they were out to get him from the start of the movie as the trailer suggests and it was portrayed just like this almost slapstick in its application this kinda ruined the horror mood for me still had its moments there were macabre aspects to this portrayal and elements of a generic type slasher film but i was left disappointed i kinda got exactly what i expected thought the ending was a bit of comic relief actually next",negative,1

539,539," this movie has the similar atmosphere of wicker man or rosemarys baby but in a modern version it is like a fresh movie using those concepts the movie is great and is well written with good acting i do not know how to explain that the movie can be sometimes slow but in a good way the movie keeps you interested even if you already figured out what is happening there are only good points in this movie i cannot think of a bad point because even the humor is well applied the concept is great

i recommend to see this movie without any doubt but if you dont like psychological suspense  horror or similar stay away from this gem

543,543," i rarely watch films that are hyped up by film critics as i know that such critics are always more impressed by the expression of their own knowledge understanding and overall genius than by anything else they try to impress the uneducated masses that is the rest of us with their brilliant analyses particularly of modern films which address what they see as serious social issues

i decided to watch get out partly because the premise looked reasonably interesting and partly because it had received some good reviews what a mistake i really should have stuck with my usual approach

for the most part its boring and predictable and as has been mentioned by other reviewers here if the colours of the main characters were reversed the film would have been greeted with outrage rather than plaudits the occasional interlude of foul language from a peripheral character and some scenes of gruesome violence in the last  minutes are largely irrelevant and unnecessary to a considerable extent the film makes little sense its nothing more than an attempt to demonstrate how badly those nasty white folk treat the black folk and how the black folk will win out in the end

there is little acting other than the now usual meaningful looks and the limited script is pretty banal overall whatever the clever critics might say its dull and has nothing new to say about anything there is no originality of any sort that said its not terrible its just very very average bordering on poor and as such it gets    from me",positive,8
544,544," take out the race element and this would be very much the sort of routine shocker you see on the horror channel except more predictable than most yet it was no doubt the race angle that allowed the producer to get the budget to give it a hollywood gloss and its also the race angle that means it doesnt quite make sense: if the bad guys are racists why do they want to be black people i had a nagging feeling  and nagging is the word  that some kind of deep allegorical meaning was intended and i think the main reason people watch this sort of thing is that they enjoy a little thrill of liberal guilt

548,548," i will briefly describe the basic values that elevate a movie from just being bytes on a medium to an over the screen experience the reason i am doing so is to contradict exactly what get out undoubtedly is not and what get out undoubtedly is not is a good movie in any sense whatsoever i will be brief and avoid any kind of spoilers as my intention is not to prevent people from watching the movie it is to keep the light of hope lit that people will start watching not looking thinking and processing not accepting forming opinions not adopting the ones for sale predictability a good movie should not be predictable it should drag you into the created background and guide you through the story without knowing what the upcoming events would be by watching get out for just  minutes i knew exactly what would follow every scene was a spoiler to the next one every dialogue was an insult to any point of intelligence quotient that the viewer a human being the supposedly most intelligent creature on the third planet that orbits around the sun  may have clich√© a definition of cliche would be the overuse of an elementexpression or idea to the point of losing its original meaning or effect even to the point of becoming trite or irritating the words written above just described the whole movie all cliches where gathered polished and submitted in a way that their sole successful contribution is making the movie even more predictable and ultimately insulting to any political animal with the power of moral reasoning meaning where some movies excelled and ensured their passage from past participle to present continuous is their underlying meaning or message left for the viewers to pick up process and interpret if i do pick up process and interpret the meaning of get out what i am left with is the notion that caucasian humans have nocturnal souls and all those caucasian nocturnal souls are boiling in vengeful lust that transforms into relentless viciousness explicitly appointed towards people with darker color of skin if racism would be fitted in a sentence it would be awfully similar to the one abovethe belief that all members of each race possess characteristics abilities or qualities specific to their race this movie is racism it is against equality it is against atonement evolution and progress

i could keep expressing my personal opinion why get out is an insult to intelligence yet i will not i would not write this review under normal circumstances and keep people to oblivion but i just found out that this movie is nominated for a plethora of oscars and it hurt every single brain cell residing in my cranial cavity please watch this movie but really watch think process and keep in mind that we sometimes have to live up to the fact we are the creature with the most processing power contained in a magnificent instrument called the brain",positive,9
549,549," i am definitely not one for horror films and if you take a look at my other reviews there is only one other review that would fit the horror genre  the exorcist and i only have that because i was forced to watch it for a film studies class which in hindsight i may have been able to request to not watch it

anyway the reason i am saying this is because i looked online beforehand to research extensively how much horror this movie contained i read a review that said it was more thriller than horror and the person wrote in detail the parts which would frighten it wasnt much of a spoiler for me because i usually dont remember the things ive read or seen when watching a movie anyway i decided to trust this person because they sounded quite honest and it was worth it for anyone out there who cannot stand horror movies i am with you and this film is ok to watch there are a few scenes that initiate jolts  and this is mainly accompanied with loud sound effects but for the most part these scenes are quite troll like in the sense that peele wanted visceral reactions as heard in an interview with jimmy kimmel and inserted these loud abrupt sound effects in order to achieve that

what i cant stand about horror movies is mainly the horrific make up costumes and of course the eerie soundtrack which no horror movie is complete without but for this movie it focuses more on the story rather than the actual scaring part and so i would say they wrongly categorized it as it is more thriller than horror

moving on kaluuya puts on an amazing performance i previous saw him in an episode of black mirror and have to say that he is really talented his expressions in get out and especially the iconic sink scene which can be seen in the trailer is phenomenal williams too does a great job and their chemistry on screen is well established i would have to say that gabriel was another actress of which the film would be incomplete without her emotionless stares are super bizarre but is what makes her character howery plays the comic relief for this film and his personality really shines through his character helps the movie stay above the line into total darkness

however the ending pushed it over the edge into ridiculousness it was bordering between being realistic but freaky and scifi comedy throughout the film but the ending just pushed it all the way into the scifi comedy realm im not saying that the genre is bad but it was so good at giving that thrilling atmosphere until it just gave it away

so in general id say that this is a great thriller with amazing acting directing and cinematography but a poor ending",positive,9
550,550," this is the story of an african american who is headed to meet his girlfriends parents once he gets there things start to go a little awkward

this movie is slow but it keeps you active it has the power of expectation which is going to make you have questions and want answers followed by great acting and music the movie will lead you to the end and probably flip you out

the horror is pretty well left behind the horror full of screamers this horror in my opinion is more psychological you will get along with the main character and feel or at least think how would it be to be living that situation

the movie also has some humor that is going yo be expressed by some stereotypes specially

but the movie has a problem it is predictable much of the situations during the movie most of all in the end are actually scenes which outcomes we are ready to see

see this movie but be patient dont worry if it is slow in the end you will realize whether it was or not a good movie",negative,1
551,551," when a movie that has  rotten tomatoes score and almost an  on imdb your hopes are high as a kite unfortunately it was a very mediocre movie the blatant use of racism was cringe worthy and i am sure there wouldve been a lot of hue and cry if the roles were reversed

after watching the movie i can confidently attribute the score and good reviews to white guilt and the liberal leaning of the reviewers of course nobody wants to trash this movie and come across as a racist

so tired of pumped up pc reviews on imdb and elsewhere

552,552," racist people want the skin of the people they feel superior to alone this big flaw makes this movie total nonsense as a political comment on top this movie is marketed as a piece of horror well there is around   horror in it maybe  but thats it on top the implemented black buddy stuff feels out of place and takes any seriousness out of this movie i dont know how this movie can get so much praise as a horror movie it is without horror as a comedy the elements of humor are a mixed experience as a thriller the comedy elements destroy every notion of a thrilling atmosphere and like i already said as a political satire etc the premise agenda is all wrong

so whats left get out is no disaster and some scenes are entertaining but all in all get out is a mediocre flick the cook didnt know if he wanted to cook a piece of haute cuisine or just a burger with some french fries

553,553," review: this is one messed up film now that i have finally watched it i can understand why some people found it quite disturbing but the ending brought some justice to the whole messed up situation daniel kaluuya plays a black photographer chris washington who is in a happy relationship with his white girlfriend rose armitage allison williams they decide to go to roses parents house and he soon realises that they have a weird outlook towards black people with a black woman and man as there servants and various statements about his colour he bites his tongue and he attends there annual party which also leads to more racial comments when chris finally decides to leave he is faced with an unbelievable situation which leads him to fight for his life i was definitely shocked with the outcome of this movie and i wasnt expecting the various twists and turns throughout its not everyday that you see a film were the black underdog triumphs with all the odds stacked up against him so i have to give the director the thumbs up the ending seemed a bit abrupt and it does take some time to get going but once it does you cant fault it for originality personality i would have got out of the house after the first day especially after seeing how weird the servants were but i can understand that he was in love with his girlfriend which is why he was willing to put up with ignorant behaviour from the messed up family and friends anyway i enjoyed the movie and its definitely worth a watch enjoyable

roundup: this is the first movie directed by jordan peele  who is known for his comedic series key  peele alongside keeganmichael key the shock success of this movie brought him to the main stream and with keanu also doing well at the box office the only way is up for the dynamic duo although daniel kaluuya isnt a household name he has starred in cass welcome to the punch kick ass  sicario and the series skins so he has had some experience in front of the camera he definitely brought some intensity to the project and it was good to see him use his brain towards the end

budget: million worldwide gross: million

i recommend this movie to people who are into their horrormysteries starring daniel kaluuya allison williams catherine keener bradley whitford caleb landry jones marcus henderson and lakeith stanfield ",positive,10
555,555," get out is an intense unnerving movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat  only if you are satisfied with an adrenal rush and not looking for any depth in the characters or the story its a great production done with superb acting music and visual arrangement but as a movie about racism it just doesnt go beyond

it starts with the romance between rosie and chris the sweet white girlfriend and the talented africanamerican photographer where rosie asks chris to spend a weekend at her posh parents country house its just a weekend but as things get awry it escalates to be a matter of life or death the backdrop can be easily taken as a trope for racial relationstension in america but contrary to what peele the director aspired to do this movie just couldnt provoke any discussion or shed light on the touchy issues to have the guests locked up in a grandiose house with two distinct camps of the white and the black is also a scene that occurs in tarantinos django unchained while django unchained uses a fictional story to unveil the cruelty and injustice of black slavery get out feels more like a sorcerers tale that manages to carry the label of racism because the victim happens to be a black the characters are diabolical and psychotic but they are also flat and uninspiring they might carry a secret agenda but it just makes them look like an underground cult group who somehow has a bit of a supernatural power ‚Äì it must be because some of the things they do are scientifically impossible eg the surgery scene their persona and the things that they can physically do ‚Äì hypnosis by the mother and surgeries by the father ‚Äì are just not representative at all they do not carry any association to racists or the xenophobic in fact they are also kind of dumb to have that kind of video conferencing setup in the room where the victim gets to talk to the perpetrator it works well if the movie wants to create suspense or terror by paying tribute to the horror classic saw but again it doesnt add any depth to an intellectual reflection on racism

some people comment that the film commits dogmatic stereotypes i think the only stereotype used here is that the black and the white are by default at war with each other yet its used more as a convenient trick to shove the audience into this themversusus mentality so we get as suspicious as chris the horror is real the acting is fantastic and does send the chill off your spine but it doesnt stimulate your thinking or perpetuate any racial prejudices if this movie is played in a virtual reality movie house its top notch but if it attempts to be meaningful it is not",positive,7

558,558," it was without no knowledge about what this movie was about when i sat down to watch get out the only thing that i did know about it was the fact that it was a horror movie and i do enjoy horror movies quite a lot

i will say that the movie does start out quite alright albeit it doesnt really have that horror genre feel to it but the story soon takes a turn into a more bizarre twist and i mean that in a good way because the way the story was constructed and set up was actually quite intricate and interesting director and writer jordan peele managed to introduce an element of confusion to the movie which keeps the audience in the dark and have the audience guessing at just what exactly is going on and that was a great accomplishment and definitely something that added a dynamic layer to the movie

and while the story did seem quite odd and bizarre it was actually a really good story and it turned out to be quite interesting and actually wellthought through

director jordan peele was able to skillfully introduce some great build ups of drama tension and suspense throughout the course of the movie and the climaxes of these build ups were equally well brought to realization as well again this really added a lot of depth and worth to the movie

furthermore the movie was really helped a great long way by having some really good acting performances by the cast i must admit that i was especially impressed with daniel kaluuyas performance and how at ease he seemed to be in this role and i was also quite impressed with betty gabriel although i think it was a shame that her role wasnt bigger and that she only had limited screen time

the odd dialogue by various characters thoughtout the entire movie actually makes sense when the revealing of what actually was happening took place i will be the first to admit that i was quite puzzled and was wondering about much of the dialogue throughout the movie but when the plot was revealed and you look back at the dialogue it all just makes perfect sense

get out is labeled as a horror mystery but i would say that the mystery aspect of the movie far outweighs the horror aspect but then again i would say it is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie regardless then get out is quite an entertaining and interesting movie

for a directorial debut for jordan peele then get out is quite an accomplishment i was more than genuinely entertained by this movie and can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch get out",negative,1

561,561," set in a post racial america get out challenges the complacency of a liberal society setting the audience with deep unease throughout the film not just by its chilling horror aspects but rather the disconcerting social attitudes audaciously identified in the white middle class family before the main story which follows chris washington daniel kaluuya and his weekend away with his girlfriend roses allison williams family the film opens with an unsettling precredits scene of a young black man being jumped to flanagan and allens run rabbit run this establishes the sincerely disturbing tone of the narrative constantly manipulating the emotions of the viewers in favour of the victims whilst still expertly retaining elements of subtlety that slowly uncover throughout the film

get out incorporates a remarkable array of horror aspects in its hr min run time ‚Äì from guts and violence to most prominently psych and emotional terror each feature is integrated stylistically culminating to form a smart and consistently tense narrative although at points flowing just like any other horror movie in terms of setup revelation and the sporadic comic relief similarly a significant suspension of disbelief is required to grasp the tenacious premise of the eventual plot drive which is unveiled in the latter third of the film thus its overarching spread is sometimes too thin and consequently struggles to candidly assemble at the end

that said however there is a great deal more to praise about the way in which director jordan peele unravels the story towards this climax the brilliant intricacy of the familys acceptance of chris culture by being overly pleasant that is superbly exacerbates the tension in the relationship not just on screen but between the audience and the characters the gradual relentless extrication of the plot is entrancing during the entire course of the film leaving many aspects rightfully open to the individual interpretation of the viewer intuitively hinting at peeles intentions to isolate the despicable root nature of racism in our society and my god does he do an exceptional job

the casting of daniel kaluuya as the lead character despite the controversy regarding his nationality ironically was an excellent decision by peele kaluuyas steady intensity makes it easy to see why the director eventually chose him for the role having never intended to cast a black british actor initially the skins and sicario costar is a captivating lead with the high forecasts for get out hopefully projecting this young talent to step into larger roles that he unequivocally deserves lil rel howery as the charming rod williams is without doubt the standout supporting member the comedic timing of his character and the relatable quality of his personality is exceptionally charismatic adding a meaningful layer of hilarity to the already fascinating spectacle and appealing to wider audiences who would not instinctively connect with the archetypal horror genre

566,566," first and foremost kudos to jordan peele never in all my years would i have expected horrordrama so well written from a comedian while the story does have its comedic aspects it is well balanced with thrills spooks and mature storytelling with a very interesting and twisted plot

as you may be well aware when it comes to the horror genre minorities are grossly misrepresented get out i believe has been the first horror movie to achieve this level of critical acclamation with a black starring role now im not basing the quality of the movie on the fact that the protagonist is a minority but am only calling to attention the rarity of this type of direction i feel like this movie opens a door of a genre in which minorities are atypical

the conceptplot of the movie is different  the good kind of different you are lead to believe one thing and the movie elegantly slaps you in the face with a twist this family is spooky as hell and they are in a league of their own while the movie does have a racial focal point its no disadvantage to the movies storytelling rather adds a level of spookiness to the reality that no matter what your race you can find yourself confronting the same horrors as anyone else this movie does seem to portray a certain allusion to slave trades and whatnot will admit but thats not inherently a bad thing unless youre one of those people that think blacks being victimized by whites can only be political correctness i actually recall many lambasting this movie as one that makes whites seem like egregious conniving devils but when watching the movie it seemed to me a white guy a representation of particular crazy individuals and not at all representative or demeaning of the entire white race like some have commentated

aside from the concept the characters in the movie are so naturally acted and convey their roles with excellent direction

this movie is no keanu prepare yourself for an actual horror film not a scary movie  this movie implements horror and comedy so well that one facet does not impend on the other and everything flows like a well though put story should

this movie was a great watch it delivers a level of creepiness complemented with a unique and creative concept and elements of black humor",positive,6

571,571, the physical chains are easy to break but the mental chains lasts for generations i mean i understand slavery and racism was and is still bad but we are in the age of computers and obama either the director still has a slave mentality or he is a ruthless promoterbusinessman who would cater to the black peoples latent slave angst from generations afar the cinematics and the settingswardrobe of the film very nicely done other than that the movie was crap i keep thinking about what a genius i am and if i only make a film i would blow the entire world away with my sublime entity of being i dont know if that day shall ever come but if destiny wills it it will be done i mean i can randomly make up films in my mind and the plot is at least  times more interesting than this film and the acting is  times better and the setting and mood is  times better the cinematics would be about  times better most directors make it in this business not because they can direct but because they have good interpersonal skills and can promote etctechnology will probably advance to the point where anyone can make a feature film easily and have people watching it when that time comes the cream will really rise to the top right now this director is surfing a wave of black movie popularism and he was successful in surfing this wave from a financial point of view i guess sigh if i can only show my genius film directing mind to the world then they will be amazed and i shall be a considered a god of thrillers humans and human psychology lol in  years through genetic mixing scientists say we would all be brown problem solved lol,negative,1

574,574," the black photographer chris washington daniel kaluuya travels with his caucasian girlfriend rose armitage allison williams to meet her family in their house in the countryside chris is worried since rose s parents do not know that he is black but he is welcomed by her father the neurosurgeon dean armitage bradley whitford her mother the psychiatrist missy catherine keener that uses hypnotism in her treatments and her brother jeremy caleb landry jones he has also a weird and cold reception from the black servants walter marcus henderson and georgina betty gabriel during the night chris feels uncomfortable and leaves the bed to breath outside the house when he returns missy is in her office and invites him to talk to her about his mother however she hypnotizes chris that freezes while his mind travels to a pitch black place called the sunken place by missy on the next morning chris wakes up in his bed and he believes he had a nightmare then he learns that there will be a family party with white guests only chris calls his best friend the airport security guard rod williams lil rel howery and he reports the weird events that happened to him when the guests arrive chris feels awkward and convinces rose to leave the house at night while packing his clothes to travel back home chris finds photographs and the dark secret of the armitage family

get out is an above average horror film by jordan peele with a flawed story about veiled racism and without any message and excessive hype the first half is great and walter georgina and andre hayworth look like characters from the  the stepford wives the second half becomes a joke and the happy ending does not fit well to the story with so many holes and evidences against chris allison williams is amazing changing her behavior from a lovely girlfriend to a cruel woman catherine keener is also excellent in the role of a cold hypnotherapist daniel kaluuya performs a noncharismatic character and the impact would be greater with an actor with more personal charm to perform chris my vote is seven

well you seen the trailer even that is boring and read the plot so no spoilers here premise is like typical madtv skit white woman wants to ko visit her parents with her black boyfriend wohoo how is this going to turn out because all the whiteys are racists epic twist they seem to be all cool then another twist with some cult action brainwashing hypnosis stuff and shitty jump scares i watched this movie a week ago and cant honesty remember anything worth remembering i like peele and guess he tried to do some sort of social commentary with this flick but falls way flat trying that in all all the twists are  predictable and the storyline is as brilliant as the wicker man acting is all the way acceptably average nothing spectacular there either this is not wicker man bad just mediocre horrorthrillercomedy you forget the second you walk out of theatre my harsh  out of  rating is bit harsh just to knock down ridiculous  imdb score and most importantly this movie got nominated for best motion picture of the year and best performance by an actor in a leading role effin really oscars have totally lost all my respect i actually laughed out when i saw this on their nominee list had to check calendar its not april fools day obviously this forgettable flick with its mediocre acting is there just got nominated because other movies dont have enough black people in them to avoid sjws outrage i dont care what racesexwhatever the cast or director is if the movie is good its good this certainly isnt",negative,4

582,582," a superbly created horror that flips the genre on its head the pacing is immaculate taking viewers from sheer terror to safe unease like the smoothest rollercoaster in the world the cinematography is beautifully threatening and the performances by kaluuya and others are intimidatingly good

better yet is a script that features realistic characters who react as the average person would there is not a single moment that will make you scream about not going into the dark basement or towards the creepy sound an upstanding horror protagonist who does everything how anyone in his circumstance would and get out is all the more terrifying for it

583,583," this movie although an entertaining movie is contributing to a growing racism toward white people in the united states how many evil white people do we need in the movies we are at a point in time that if this movie was made with black people brainwashing white people it would be celebrated while white people brainwashing black people is what gives it its horror enough with this obsession over race it so typical that it means this movie actually lacks creativity the worst part is the response white people receive who have shown support for this movie they are quickly labeled with cultural appropriation

587,587, honestly im not sure what to think about this it seems that lately every movie has become a battleground for one political side or the other personally i just want to see a good movie is this one one as far as craftsmanship goes maybe full disclaimer: i watched this because of the honest trailer so i knew what was the basic premise going to be however i expected that the timeframe was going to be s or such right at the beginning it becomes apparent that its obama or postobama era the people have better and newer cellphones than i do then its explicitly stated later that its postobama era seriously you want to talk about racism in postobama era every person of color in this movie lives in a more expansive apartment than i do and wears brand clothes im not buying it this movie is supposed to be a horror but it isnt scary at all its more like a comedy about liberals you cant be scared if theres no survivor for you to be invested in imagine if the alien was made from an omniscient perspective and the xenomorph would be revealed to be a transsexual libertarian who just wants to make a living you wouldnt be very scared than would you the visuals are very derivative from the skin i wear but unlike that one it doesnt really draw you in but all in all the movie doesnt really suck it doesnt make much sense either but it doesnt suck so by todays standards its like avengers: endgame it was a time when hollywood made movies had at least some redeeming qualities nowadays they dont even bother to write a real script or hire real actors,negative,3

first of all this movie is not racist as some reviews may suggest it is good highquality thriller that uses known subject but gives it an extra twist

throughout entire movie youll probably be interested and think about what is next leaves you expecting which means youll keep focuse dont look for deeper political meaning because the director did not aim at that subject imho it is just a well made movie using race issues in past to make good storyline simple as that

the beginning is simple the middle is quite a ride and ending gives some satisfaction but leaves you kinda wondering

610,610," let me start off by saying this: get out is far from a bad film it is genuinely frightening at times and dare i say even genius at some moments but the films biggest problem is that it knows it is a step above other horror films and it reeks of self importance when you take into consideration the political climate in america get out is a film that is hitting at a right time it is tackling white liberal racism in the upper middle class and it does a very good job at making its point however as the film goes on and the scares become more frequent the film starts feeling cheesy and overwritten even if the performances are truly stunning

director jordan peele makes the most out of his cast daniel kaluuya gives a truly magnificent performance as chris while bradley whitford and catherine keener are utterly horrifying as the armitages however allison williams is a weak link and is very dry in her delivery which makes her performance comes off as wooden she is the weak link and it isnt hard to figure it out especially in her scenes with kaluuya the story progresses and williams performance is slowly twiddled down which then leaves the glaring issue of the script while the characters in this film are really layered and relateable the story they are in is so overwritten and self indulgent that it is hard to consider this the horror gem many critics and audiences are calling it

the idea of a great horror film is to thrill and scare while making a social commentary we look back on such films as rosemarys baby night of the living dead friday the th maybe halloweenthese films have weight to them and you dont know it until its over with get out we know this is a film with political undertones we know it wants us to think this is something more than a horror film in some regards it is but in most it is just a horror film that thinks it is more important than it actually is this takes from what peele is trying to achieve with directing a horror film everything comes off being very tonguein cheek instead of being straight horrifying and that is probably the most disappointing factor with get out instead of sinking these political undertones in the writing peele makes them abundantly clear and it ends up taking away from a film that is otherwise pretty good

get out is a step above your average horror film and features some pretty amazing performances despite this the film suffers from a very weak script that will feel as if youre being hit over the head with political banter rather than having the sht scared out of you overall i was pretty disappointed in get out but the film does feature some awesome performances and some genuine scares that will be enough to make you wish the film was better",positive,10
611,611," jordan peele has been famous as part of the comedy team key  peele it might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie but he did and his get out is a horror movie that serves as a biting satire basically its a look at how white people will often get into black culture but still wont accept blacks as their equals think about it: how many white people enjoyed chuck berrys songs but wouldve refused to let him come into their businesses i dont know that i would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece but i wont deny that its one of the cleverest things that ive seen all year a mixture of horror drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the st century once thought dead due to obamas election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police

chris daniel kaluuya is a successful black man whose girlfriend rose allison williams is taking him to meet her parents for the firs time chris is worried that theyre going to be put off by him being black but rose assures him that theyre not racist at first chris is welcomed by mom catherine keener and dad bradley whitford but soon he begins to realize that something isnt quite right

jordan peele wrote and directed this film which pretty much came out of nowhere and became a huge hit with critics and it was an even bigger hit with crowds i dont think anyone would have guessed that this film would have made the amount of money that it eventually did but its refreshing to see get out is certainly a rather strange picture and its one id call liberal horror and id also lump dont breathe into that genre i think both films are incredibly interesting and the best part about both of them is the fact that afterwards you can have a discussion about their politics which is something not too common for a horror picture

for the most part this was a very impressive horror film but im not even sure id call it a horror movie id probably lean towards calling it a mystery with a pinch of thriller thrown in the film really plays out like a great episode of the twilight zone as we got a terrific setting a racial undertone and some great performances that keep you guessing at whats going on we really dont figure out whats happening until theres about twentyfive minutes left to go in the film and i must say that peele did a wonderful job in the directors chair by having the film hold your attention obviously theres a strong screenplay that manages to hold your attention even when theres not much action going on

the film also benefits from some terrific performances kaluuya is certainly wonderful in the lead role as he has a lot of different emotions to play not only is he the fish out of water but his character is also given some personal drama that plays out throughout the film williams is also extremely good because shes playing someone that you dont know where the character stands she has to walk straight down the line to keep the mystery going and she does so perfectly both keener and whitford are extremely good as well as is marcus henderson

as i said the racial and political elements are right in your face and its refreshing seeing a horror movie that doesnt shy away from this the alternate ending is actually a lot better than whats on the theatrical cut but its easy to see why it was changed heck im shocked that the screenplay was even able to get funding i think the first hour is much better than the final thirtyfive minutes and especially when the mystery is finally revealed im not going to spoil anything but get out certainly makes you discuss what its about afterwards",positive,9
614,614," greetings from lithuania

so after seeing glowing reviews from critics and amazing score here at imdb of get out  as a horror movie mega fan i was kinda dying to see this movie after finally seeing it can safely say  this is simply of the very best actually the best at the moment movie in  in my opinion and i saw tons of film this year

get out isnt true terror horror movie its not even the best horror movie out the at the moment to be honest what makes this film special is its kinda mind blowing story jawdraping writing and perfect directing yes the acting by everyone involved was more then uniformly good especially by allison williams  this is a star making performance how perfectly smoothly and involving everything here is done is just beyond me  this newcomer writer  director jordan peele should be on a map of every movie goer from now on  it is hardly gets better then get out

615,615," writers are told write what you know for jordan peele that meant writing and directing s get out r : but also stretching significantly as an artist half of the comedy central comic duo of key and peele peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of the second city improv troupe and madtv the product of an interracial marriage much of peeles comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the us while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues his talent and insight have earned him nominations for the emmy award and naacp image award multiple times each ‚Äì including one emmy win an american comedy award and a peabody award for accomplishments in public media peele has also appeared in films including s keanu with comedy partner keeganmichael peele television shows and internet videos all of those experiences serve him well in get out a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world but is actually more horror film than anything else

chris washington daniel kaluuya is a new york city photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend rose armitage allison williams in order to meet her parents for the first time chris is nervous about how roses parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and chris buddy tsa agent rod williams lil rel howery teases him over the phone about the situation rose reassures chris that her parents are very liberal and openminded as rose predicted her father dean bradley whitford and her mother missy catherine keener welcome chris with open arms

it turns out that they are not racist but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants both of whom are black walter marcus henderson the groundskeeper and georgina betty gabriel the maid both act so politely that it seems phony to chris not to mention that they both speak very strangely when roses brother jeremy caleb landry jones shows up for dinner he is even rougher around the edges than his parents things get even more uncomfortable for chris when an annual gathering at the armitage home introduces chris to a host of rich white people much like roses parents except for a blind art dealer played by stephen root while one older woman is married to a young black man lakeith stanfield who looks vaguely familiar to chris but who doesnt act anything like the black men that chris knows from back in his native brooklyn

but its not just the way everyone acts that makes chris uncomfortable ‚Äì its also the things that are happening around him a police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats chris like he did something wrong even though he wasnt driving at the time missy who is a psychiatrist voices her strong opposition to chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing chris in order to help him break the habit even after chris turns down her offer she also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood chris talks to rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then chris starts finding his phone unplugged it also turns out that rose hasnt been entirely forthcoming about her dating history id like to say more but i wont because as much as ive already written there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover

get out is an inventive insightful and very entertaining film although admittedly influenced by the stepford wives what happens in this movie and why its happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in america even from sympathetic and wellmeaning people and groups in fact its easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism but generally as a movie fan i see it mainly as a wellcrafted horror film theres a certain creepiness about it that starts early and then slowly steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals some of the plot points strain scientific credulity but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy the film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted theres also some funny effective and wellplaced comic relief from howerys character thats to be expected from someone like jordan peele but who knew that he would be so good at horror this movie feels like one of m night shyamalans better films with a strong subtext of social commentary for so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of a",positive,6
616,616," is get out changing the future of horror flicks

i know the media makes it seem like many white people are scared of darker skin people on the other hand there is an equal amount of fear some darker skin people are actually afraid of caucasians

now ive never really been that kind of person¬Öbecause of all those white women horniness will overcome fear yeah thats right ive been up in that game before im just kidding but in all seriousness ive never really been afraid of someone just because of the color of their skin unless im in the middle of a neo ‚Äì nazi rally or a klan meeting i dont think i have much to be afraid of

but for a lot of brothers and sisters out there being the only person of color in a large group can be a little mysterious at times a lot of things can come across your mind if you are put into that situation such as what happened to everyone else am i though token are these people going to kill me and that is exactly what goes through the mind of our main character chris

so how long has this been going on ‚Äî this ¬Ö thang

when chris comes across roses parents played by bradley whitford billy madison the cabin in the woods and catherine keener capote the yearold virgin lets just say roses parents are acting a little off the wall theyre simply acting fckin weird

i can see where this movie might anger some people mainly because it deals with race race issues social issues and other heavy topics on the other hand if you truly see this movie and open your mind youll see that this movie is one of the best horror filmscomedies in a really long time i absolutely had a terrific time seeing this in theaters and i think most people are loving this film right here

im just gonna dive into it and give you the inside scoop the movie does a remarkable job at building up tension it starts off with an awkward encounter with roses parents then things really flip a switch its bloody scary violent has social commentary and it all works the humor works the horror works and the thriller ride is a real journey the movie is really a great mix up of different genres in one later on in the film we are introduced again to chris best friend rod played by lil rel howery the carmichael show

ts motherfckin a saves the day

rod truly is the comedy gold of this movie everything from his theory on chris becoming a sex slave for these people to him believing he is the baddest tsa officer on the block

in a way i feel like rod was the character that can relate to the audience meaning rod ask chris what we would ask our friend if they were put in that situation such as how are you not scared of this speaking of people in the theater this audience was really passionate having fun and really enjoying the movie from start to finish people in the theater were clapping cheering screaming and this is the type of film that made an audience come to life one young lady was sitting next to me and she tapped me a total stranger and said to me with a mouth full of popcorn and shiny buttered lips damn this movie is hella good

hence the writing the directing and the direction is all very artistic fun relatable and i had a great time with this movie i actually cant wait to see this movie again when it comes to a perfect blend of horror and comedy this is what kevin smiths tusk film should have been like

the comedy doesnt feel forced it has great tension an original story has a message and there is not one dull point in this movie i believe get out earns¬Ö

 out of 

so if you havent seen get out what are you still doing reading this review get out and go see get out

so how long has this been going on ‚Äî this ¬Ö thang long enough for me to close the book on this review for now and possibly get back up in the game of some pretty white women ill take the risk until next time thank you all for reading and or viewing and i hope you all get out and have an amazing day as always :",positive,7
617,617," this was done in the style of the stepford wives very interesting and very disturbing it was not an antiwhite movie in the same way stepford was not against men nor marriage a very creative idea to take one dating scenario and turn it on its head  instead of a married couple

it was a fiction based movie in a modern setting once a lead character is chosen several other options for consistency follow the girl from girls and the guy from black mirror  million merits was a nice casting choice for the leads

the plot was suspenseful the pace was lively and the acting was great horror film stuff

well done

620,620, get out directed by jordan peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story surrounding an african american man meeting his girlfriends caucasian family the first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension the start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown i really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off all the performances were great particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion also the cinematography was very nice containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts as for negatives there are quite a few the tone of this film is very messy i wished the horror really got under my skin although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief to me this broke all the tension and really made me question the type of film i was watching there are also quite a few plot holes and scenes which really dont have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience once the film reaches the third act i was really let down by the direction they took i was expecting a smart and unique revelation but all i got was a standard messed up horror movie twist i think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket i really thought this movie would be insanely smart but honestly its really not that special it didnt impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have its a solid and enjoyable film but its far from groundbreaking so therefore i give get out a  i feel like many will disagree with my rating if you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead one thing i still dont see is why african americans were targeted in the film when it was asked the question was just brushed off,positive,5
621,621," went to watch this film after hearing good things about it and seeing the overwhelmingly good reviews on imdb and rotten tomatoes but unfortunately i am severally unimpressed whilst the film was ok it did not live up to the hype the plot was predictable and transparent and for labeling itself as a horror it wasnt scary at all though i understand that its trying to make a point and i feel it does this very well since its influenced so many people but overall i would say this film is average and i would much rather reccomend my friends something else

626,626," wondering what it would take for the american movie critics to call out a plagiarized idea when they see it i mean it couldnt be more obvious or maybe the us is trying to say plagiarism is not such a serious offense like it is in europe you steal an idea you change a thing or two not to be very obvious hoodoo w hypnosis and you capitalize money over someone elses intellectual work pretending its your original creation we praise the horror and the satire sure its a better movie i agree but we miss the bigger picture great stuff

im not exactly certain what writerdirector jordan peele was aiming for messagewise here only that he succeeds wildly for the most part in crafting an unnerving potboiler vibe right from the ghastly getgo the hallmark of any topnotch thriller no matter the plot is to keep us guessing anticipating what in the hell we may watch go down next peele does this in expert fashion and does it in spades

and if youve seen or now plan to see get out please understand that i certainly do not mean that as any socioracial play on words

662,662," jordan peele has described this movie as a social thriller and in some respects his use of small subtle cues to build a growing sense of unease borrows heavily from the psychological thriller genre made popular by alfred hitchcock part of this films strength lies in the frank examination of social expectations and nonverbal communication chris the main character sees and hears many things that bother him and contribute to his anxiety but because he is in a social situation where awkwardness and stereotypical gaffes are something he expects he writes off many of his experiences as misunderstandings or coincidences or of examples of ways in which his own social expectations are out of place he is unable to clearly verbalize whats bothering him he therefore overlooks things that to his friend rod are gigantic warning flags while voluntarily putting himself in a situation where he is more and more helpless to escape when he finally realizes hes in danger

it may be necessary to draw a distinction between a psychological thriller wherein the key factor driving the plot and the decision making of the characters is the internal thoughts and feelings of the characters and a social thriller in which the tension comes from the interaction between different characters and the contrast in their expectations as to what behavior is or is not appropriate is a particular behavior creepy abnormal and worthy of a jump scare or is it simply a normal aspect of a social situation in which the main character is not comfortable the way chris begins to question and secondguess himself and the way he starts to doubt his own instincts and intuition comes almost entirely from the social aspects of the situation hes in

unlike many horror films in which the victims do phenomenally stupid things this film accurately depicts exactly why chris tolerates what most people would consider inappropriate behavior and why he stays at the armitage home instead of leaving every single decision he makes is completely understandable even when it puts him at risk frequently even his riskier behavior is the only possible option given his life experiences and his emotional state

race and racism are omnipresent in this movie and some of it is overt chris is treated differently objectified and patronized by the armitages and some of their friends in the midst of a scene where white racial stereotypes of black people are being trotted out and exaggerated to the point of hilarity peele injects a few lines of dialogue with a japanese character who ironically can easily be interpreted as a stereotype with layer after layer of irony the film subtly mocks its own effort to deconstruct racial stereotyping

lacking the stereotypical gratuitous nudity and sex many people associate with horror this movie has several violent scenes at the end but is not gratuitously gory the victims helplessness and the casual predatory nature of the villains who really are up to something is conveyed almost entirely through the acting which is outstanding many horror conventions are turned on their heads such as who the victims are and who the villain or villains might be

it is also important to pay attention to the score the background music for this movie is spectacular particularly sikiliza kwa wahenga",negative,4
663,663," i had heard several great reviews of this film and saw the high rating on rotten tomato  so with my th or so friend having gone to see it and raving about it i finally made the go

i was definitely not disappointed the key ingredients of a good thriller for me is to have compelling characters the right amount of humor jump scenes and psychological tie together at the end this movie had that and more

the director blended enough what the hell is going on thoughts with funny comic relief to keep me engaged the entire film i felt like there may have been more room for a few more jumpy parts but overall this will be a goto thriller to recommend to people wanting a great flick to watch that will tie together really well in the end

666,666," get out is the story of how a black guy‚Äîchris played by the marvellous daniel kaluuya‚Äîand his white girlfriend visit her parents mansion at the countryside at first sight his girlfriends parents seem just fine with chris being black but he soon discovers that something is off the black servants at the mansion are behaving oddly as if brainwashed and as he digs deeper more secrets about hist girlfriends family are being revealed

get out is witty as hell it deals with racial stereotypes in a funny way turning them outward and explicit by making racial divides within the us the premise of a horror movie the script is spoton with just enough jokes to keep you laughing just enough racial subtext to make it cringeworthy and just enough seriousness so as to not destroy the suspense and it is there where get out excels: in many movies suspense and comedy are mutually exclusive not here get out manages to keep both up and going till the very end

mix into this great performances both on the protagonist and the villains side good cinematography some fun play with us accents selfawareness of and commentary on horror movie tropes  perfected with a dash of violence and gore  and youll end up with something thats truly unique managing to deliver many complex emotions simultaneously while still just being outright fun",positive,8
667,667," get out is a timely entry in these cynical pressurecooker of times it is a piece of compelling entertainment ensnaring the viewer with a rising intensity of stirring paranoia it is a sly whipsmart satire of our current world wrecked day in day out with racial tension and inequality how it never becomes top down heavy and preachy is sheer mastercraft

part of the fun of get out is the winding twists and audacious turns and a discussion of the plot will rob you of the fun so i will refrain from doing that and will also not post the trailer best to go in blind believe the hype

writerdirector jordan peeles debut film is assured and deliciously wicked get out feels like an extended twilight zone episode it is a potent genre blender pushing many racism buttons sending them up in a refreshing manner without being preachy peeles comedic roots is showcased here and the hightensioned wireact is neatly interspersed with some hilarious respites which believe me is much needed peele also achieved some great tonal shifts as the narrative easily slides out of comedy into horror and vice versa with a snap i love narratives i cant guess the outcome and even though i could see some twists coming ahead of time i never felt shortchanged because the characters are so well drawn and the situation so twisted

daniel kaluuya best remembered as emily blunts sidekick in sicario and an episode in the excellent black mirror series is outstanding as the deer caught in the headlights he demonstrated a lot of range and his character arc left me breathless as he raced toward the devastating finale it is a dazzling performance that will make your blood run cold

when the ultraviolent final denouement rolled in i was punching my fist in the air only the really good ones can make me do this it is definitely one of the most satisfying endings i have experienced in cinema and peele has knocked it out of the park with his first film cleverly written with a pulse on todays crazy world and deeply unsettling this darkly funny examination of what happens when you have got nothing left to lose is brilliantly addictive this is a mustsee for anyone who is occasionally reckless ruthless or just plain psychologically weird and anyone who loves clever movies",positive,10
669,669," jordan peele has really put a good story together in the horror genre in addition to directing a good cast of established and new actors who in there own right gave this script life there are many layers to the film in varying subject matter without loosing the main story line cant wait to see what peele does next in this genre well worth the watch

670,670," months before the official trailers were released someone sent me a trailer of this movie after seeing that the writer and director was jordan peele i thought that it was a joke jordan peele is a comedian so this must be some spoof trailer for his show key and peele then months passed and the official trailer was out no its not a joke this movie is very real and its not a comedy

a young black man chris daniel kaluuya goes to visit the parents of his white girlfriend rose alison williams already tense enough due to the uncertainty of how his girlfriends parents will receive him he finds that many of roses parents make racially insensitive comments and the few other black people around behave very strangely just why they behave so strange is the mystery that chris sets out to uncover

this movie wasnt so much a horror as it was a thriller it did have its jump scares and an eerie feel to it but i still wouldnt classify it as a scary movie the performances were on point and the story itself was intriguing this was a movie in which you could view for simple entertainment or look deeper and make parallels between it and real life already there are several articles pointing out some interesting symbolism

i appreciated both: the entertainment value and some of the deeper meanings to the film it was well thought out and mixed the pace quite nicely there was a steady diet of mysterious content interspersed with genuine comedy with a blanket of creepiness over the entire dish jordan peele just made himself a legitimate player in the writing and directing game",positive,9
671,671," as a key  peele fan im guessing my reaction to hearing jordan peele had written and directed a horror movie was similar to other fans reactions: oh hell no or oh brother

then it was hyped as  fresh according to the illustrious tomatometer forcing my hand into getting out into a movie theater to get get out get out a simple title brings the issue up front: people who endure racial discrimination might feel a need to leave but often do not have a viable option

other critics have championed get out by comparing it to john carpenters they live or even the stepford wives thats going far too far they live will endure as a classic criticism of capitalism to be blunt get out is not that iconic or special it is however an important reminder that progressive white america does not have a realistic understanding of what racial discrimination is or feels like im not racist sounds trite just as trite as a majority groups opinion on whether or not any particular behavior or attitude is racist

lilrel howery steals the show every time he appears especially when he warns his friend about becoming a sex slave progressive whites are probably more worried about losing wifi connectivity or a coupon expiring the bourgeois teacup and teaspoon become a weapon salvation comes from cellphone flashes

in get out nothing is as what it seems it is not as much about racism but pointing out we often fail to recognize it",positive,10
672,672," from the mind of comedic genius jordan peele comes get out a new horrorcomedy that delivers the laughs and thrills at a milea minute and generally excels in every department despite a few minor hiccups in the pacing department horror and comedy are very unique and strangely similar genres both very much based on instinctual and visceral reactions the tendency to fear in terrible situations and the desire to laugh and its always a pleasure to see a film that combines them so well together add in a dash of alltooreal social satire regarding subliminal racism and you got one of the better mainstream creep shows in recent time

the excellent daniel kaluuya and delightful allison williams star as chris and rose an interracial couple preparing to spend their first weekend together with roses parents while chris has some minor worries about what theyll say about their daughter dating a black man for the most part things seem more orless ordinary when the first arrive save for roses father dean armitage bradley whitford trying a bit too condescendingly hard to be a cool and openminded guy you know i would have voted for obama a third time so how long has this thang been going on and his psychiatrist wife missy catherine keener pressuring chris to stop smoking for health reasons but things quickly start to go a little strange especially when it comes to the armitages black servants walter and georgina marcus henderson betty gabriel acting increasingly outofthe ordinary and missys push to try and use hypnosis to cure chris smoking habits and soon enough chris will discover that despite the idyllic facade crafted by the armitage household there are dark secrets hidden away within the home that could spell doom for he and rose

peele proves a more than capable firsttime director in this spine tingling tale and he loving pays homage to a number of the genre classics that have obviously inspired him while never going to far as to lose originality with shades of everything from the stepford wives to night of the living dead peele is obviously an affectionate fan of oldschool horror and weaves in subtle and rewarding parallels that other fans might pick up on his eye for composition is quite stirring and i was really taken by some genuinely effective uses of extreme wide and extreme closeups that pleasantly reminded me of some of the greats like hitchcock and even sergio leone in a few key moments i also appreciated his general sense of deliberation peele doesnt feel the need the throw in loud stingers and nonstop jumps to jolt the audience into paying attention he knows atmosphere is key

the script is a great deal of fun and peeles handling of characters and the subtle racism of oldschool societal expectation leads to many moments of pure gold while he never lets up on the evergrowing and slowlybuilding sense of tension and intrigue he injects just enough humor of the film much of which relates to a delightful character played by lil rel howery to give the audience breathing room and supply some genuine laughs the fun thats had with social satire especially about subtle racism is a breath of fresh air and adds quite a bit of depth to the films story when chris is told that his being black is fashionable and in nowadays by a character who is trying to be nice to him despite dehumanizing him into little more than a fashion statement you cant help but both laugh and cringe a little on the inside because you definitely know thats the sortof thing that all too many people hear in the real world

the cast is just perfect kaluuya is endlessly likable and plays his lead role in a very thoughtful way you always get the sense that theres a lot going on beneath the surface even when he tries to play it cool for the sake of his relationship and theres a lot of really nice moments that delve into his past that give kaluuya some good material to sink his teeth into williams is sweet and likable ive only really been familiar with her through her singing and music so it was a very pleasant surprise to see her stretch her acting chops in such a good role keener and whitford are phenomenal in their roles and have a ton of great moments while you know something is definitely up with them you havent seen the half of it until youve seen the film and supporting roles by the likes of howery henderson and gabriel and even a small cameorole by the great stephen root are exceptionally well played

really the only thing holding the film back from attaining a perfect  from me are some very troubling issues i took with the pacing and structure in the films second half whereas most films tend to outstay their welcome and go on for a bit too long i felt get out was perhaps about  minutes too short and the third act in particular rockets by in a way that made it lose some of its impact for me theres also a few jarring scene transitions in the moments leading up to the climax that felt inorganic which also hurt it the film really has an ideal first two acts and merely a pretty decent but not quite great finale

still i cant do anything but give jordan peeles get out the highest of recommendations its already one of my favorite films of the year and i cant wait to see it again and again

i give it an excellent  out of ",negative,4
673,673," seriously if youve pondered on whether seeing the film or not please do yourself a favor and go see it its worth the admission

jordan peele known for key  peele makes an excellent first impression in his directorial debut he brings a fresh take on typical horror movies implementing the obvious but subtle racial tension and sharp satirical wit

a young africanamerican man named chris visits his girlfriend roses mysterious caucasian family estate and from there on a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined

in most horror films guys like chris exceptionally played by daniel kaluuya end up dead really quick its an overused clich√© but it is reversed in this film and to see an africanamerican male protagonist front and center is a nice change of pace within the horror genre

whats also great is that the film showcases his paranoia he knows something is up hes not blind to it he makes the smart decisions and plays it cool he isnt some dumb protagonist ready to be next on the chopping block kaluuya is great at playing a doomed man who thinks hes in control of the entire situation on the surface he looks confident and at ease as he has sharp eyes taking notes on everyones behavior and it doesnt take a genius to figure out something is odd youre never quite sure whats going on at the girlfriends home whether everyones involved in some sinister plot or if its just some awkward misunderstanding but its clear that something is happening and chris is the most normal person here and as the audience member were not given any reason to doubt him

kaluuya also has great chemistry with allison williams who portrays his girlfriend rose they both get to showcase their moments as a couple together very well and im quite positive theyll get more recognition into furthering their careers

the characters are fleshed out immaculately with bradley whitford and catherine keener in their best performances to date caleb landry jones also has an appropriately intensely edgy role a tad bit over the top i might add whenever the film needs a short moment of humor a lot of the films levity comes from lil rel howery as rod chris best friend

in some areas the film does take its time to get things going but peele strategically knows where to add elements into the film to build up the tension for example he knows where to showcase creepy sound effects and music cues he successfully increases the level of anxiety relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eye it is reminiscent in the ways of a hitchcock or kubrick film

get out embraces the stereotypes and embraces them very well social commentary is very relevant and poignant in the film peele allows the viewer to see prejudice head on when all is said and done you now have a birds eye view of what is really wrong with society the film definitely shines light on the aspect of ourselves that a lot of us would rather not acknowledge or be in denial of as much as we try to convince ourselves that were above forming preconceptions and stereotyping we arent peele uses this as a tool to bleed out anxiety and tension which very much fuels the entire film

all the slow build up leads to one of the most satisfying climaxes ive seen in a while in a horror film peele is the true star of this film he brings a distinctive visual style carving out the films creative path with some dark reveals addresses the variable levels of racism with subtly pays homage to some great horror films and at times very humorous as well

there have been some quality horror films of this era sinister paranormal activitynot the cash grab sequels the conjuring lights out but get out is one of those horror films that is intellectually engaging and selfaware for me it ranks up there with scream and cabin in the woods

674,674," i always say that horror and comedy have a very thin divide between them in both genres you are trying to get an extreme reaction out of your audience whether it be laughs or screams this may be why writerdirector jordan peele half of the comedy duo key  peele was able to make such a smart and wellexecuted horrorcomedy

get out has a simple premise a black man falls a white girl and goes to meet her family he is nervous about her familys reaction due to the fact that his girlfriend has never dated a black man as he goes from his comfortable urban setting to the country bumpkin locale of her familys home he begins to feel unsettled by her familys attitude and the behavior of all of the african americans in the area there are multiple ways in which jordan peele deals with modern racism that incredibly intelligent

some of the alltime great horror films have dealt with race as a subtext both night of the living dead and dawn of dead have subliminal racial contexts that take some reading into get out brings race issues into the forefront as the central conflict of the plot as we of course understand racism has quite changed since  and  when the first two dead movies were made in get out the subtle racism of modern is depicted the details of this film are what make it executed so well throughout the film small little allusions to stereotypes to slavery are a constant throughout the film if you are perceptive enough to pick up on them peele said that he wanted to make a movie we would all want to watch twice and he definitely succeeded with his precise placements of minuscule but important details many times statements we make we truly do not believe they are racist even though we are trying to connect and relate to another human being this film brings these to the forefront to be examined by its audience also the film challenges the stereotypical role of the african american man in the horror movie and tries to change this context within the bounds of the film

what really helps get out is getting oscar and golden globe nominees like catherine keener and bradley whitford as well as rising stars like allison williams and lakeith stanfield in your horror movie many times studios are just concerned about how they can make a movie for as small of a budget as possible so they can maximize profit the studio is not concerned usually how good the movie is as long as it makes money these shoe string budgets usually do not have the room for great talent in front of or behind the camera maybe get out can prove to studios that this talent is necessary to make the horror film great again as a sidenote i love that some old white studio heads had to approve a lashing criticism of the subtle racism of white people viscerally it appeals to me for some reason

get out has put itself among the alltime horror greats while being intellectually engaging and roaringly funny this probably the best horror comedy since cabin in the woods if a movie makes you hate the ways of the race you were born as by the time the credits role it has succeeded in its purpose",positive,8
675,675," when an interracial couple decides to take it to the next level things get a bit uncomfortable

chris and rose have been dating for a few months so rose decides that its time chris meets her family at first chris is a little nervous about meeting his white girlfriends family but rose assures him that her family doesnt care about his skin color when he first arrives at their estate things seems to be running smoothly and better than he expected but after having an odd encounter with roses mother things take a turn for the worse

this satirical thriller will be sure to keep you on the edge of your seat the storyline is genius and relevant while the dialogue is witty and eerie the film seems to be more of a comedy than a horror but thats what makes it so scary get out has an excellent way of making the viewer feel uncomfortable about societies cultural appropriation the cinematography is clean sharp and satisfying the films score is definitely one of my favorites american composer michael abels is what holds the film together the whole way through included in the score theres some blues folk rap and traditional african chant the cast was great and genuinely captured the films flow the relationship between chris and his best friend rod was perfect and refreshing‚Äîthey had the audience cheering from beginning to end

now dont get me wrong i absolutely loved the film but it was way too predictable for me twenty minutes in i already knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to end i only wish that they kept the concept more on the subtle side and harder to predict nothing makes me love a film more than its twists and turns but unfortunately get out didnt have any of that aside from its predictability i loved everything else about it it seems to be a modernday version of the skeleton key meshed with the satire from the visit

678,678," this movie was a good attempt at horror by jordan peele but it was just that a good attempt the movie itself was an adequate film but nothing special i cant understand the hype of this film i think most of the reviews ive read from newspaper and magazine publicists are giving this film more credit than what its truly worth i also think its just a case of the movie being released during a time of year when no other anticipated films were set to be released

the movie starts out slow when rose armitage a white girl takes her black boyfriend played by chris washington to visit her supposed liberal minded parents and friends of her parents and then after many slow reveals things take a violent turn it starts out slow with a lot of build up along the way for the big reveal but the big reveal isnt really that surprising and the ending falls thin and feels abrupt none of the scary reveals actually felt scary the comic relief in the film is low grade humor to lighten the situation from character chris washingtons tsa friend daniel kaluuya plays his part well but most of the acting felt flat and the story felt blah there have been much better horror films released lately i wouldnt believe the hype of the positive reviews it really is just an average forgettable movie i think dont breathe from last year was a much more intense and better made horror flick youll forget about get out in a few weeks",positive,10

a young black man visits his white girlfriends family estate where he learns that many of its residents who are black have gone missing and he soon learns the horrible truth when a fellow black man on the estate warns him to get out he soon learns this is easier said than done

its almost as if they had a very short story that they needed to add lots and lots of filler to lengthen this film out

lets talk about the positives  acting  superb lead role by daniel kaluuya hes come a long way since being a parking warden on harry and paul  can see this m plus box office hit from a m budget catapulting him into the hollywood big time  great supporting roles from the rest of the cast in particular caleb jones whos sinister presence was felt in every scene he appeared in  music  the music was superb right from the  run rabbit run opening scene  eerie and atmospheric throughout 

for a horror there probably werent enough jump out of your seat moments but it certainly was a cerebral horror and had elements of classics such as wicker man  the village and hostel in there

706,706," get out is creepy horrormystery involving hints of great humor and strong message behind the terrifying plot daniel kaluuya who plays the main character chris washington does a brilliant job in showing what the character is boldly thinking and does this with uses of thoughts out loud normally i would see this type of acting unprofessional however this fitted in brilliantly with jordan peeles style of comedy he wanted to added smartly into the horror the rest of the cast do a amazing job at giving that uncomfortable feeling chris is going through the moment they pull into the drive way of the house it immediately feels scary and that something isnt quite right

although some scary scenes were quite predictable and had their fair share of jump scares the originality was most definitely their and is definitely a completely out there horror we havent seen for a while i particularly impressed by the opening scene especially after hearing it was filmed in one take it put viewers straight into the plot of the film and gives you a mysterious overview of the villain in the film and how it is later shown towards the end of the film lots of links between scenes were used to form a great use of intensity that had me trying to hide in my jumper

lilrel howery who played rod a very close friend to chris completely stole the show with every scene he was included in he uplifted the film at the perfect moments with great use of humor and had some of the best lines in the script by far the twist was absolutely perfect and was portrayed at a great time in the movie and was surprisingly unpredictable it also formed a good transition to start the grand finale of the filming

the film was not riddled with action and contained a large amount of slow yet interesting scenes that gave clues towards the whole mystery behind the family and house jordan peele was able to enlarge the worldwide problem of racism and had almost everybody thoroughly thinking about how african americans are still treated in certain states of america that i admittedly wasnt aware of was still occurringeven though the film showed a unrealistic and paranormal theme it related effectively with lots of real life scenarios

in conclusion get out was heavily intense scary and enjoyable film especially considering it was jordan peeles first ever film directing you can definitely tell that the plot was well thought through and im excited to see more films by mr peele down the line of the film industry i would most certainly watch this film again and recommend it to anyone",positive,7

you are uncomfortable with interracial relationships specifically between a black man and white woman this is actually sort of a theme in this movie since many such relationships are depicted including lots of smooching and a sex scene


you cant handle nearly every white character being vilified as evil or racist toward black people this is the directorwriters jordan peele type of humor so if you cant handle whites being made fun of or stereotyped then steer clear of this one

720,720," out of all the possible genre combinations horror and comedy are probably the most difficult to combine im not sure if first time director jordan peele impresses more with that particular balance or with his ability to effectively display social commentary

blumhouse productions is putting together quite the resume their films continue to make bank at the box office but the diversity of their horror features are nothing to scoff at either just in the last few years alone theyve made films like the gift the visit split and now get out all original twists on the horrorthriller genre get out may be the most impressive yet

i always talk about my disconnect with the horror genre and how i dont find much substance with  of the films get out turns the genre on its head doesnt rely on jump scares is surrounded by tremendous performances and has a socially relevant script it is so rare for a film to have a socially relevant message without feeling too political or one sided i cant tell you how many times ive appreciated what a film or a tv show is saying but i get turned off by the way its portrayed get out manages to make an entertaining horrorthriller while also commenting on unintentional and benevolent racism coming from a white family towards their daughters new boyfriend an african american

its the racism most people dont normally think about the people who say they arent racist because they voted for barack obama or maybe because tiger woods is their favorite athlete films like  years of slave and the recent documentary th are important but its films like get out that are more effective because they are giving the same message in a different way brilliantly written and structured peele gets the most out of his actors and times the laughs and scares in an effective manner please go out and support an original film like get out you wont be disappointed

daniel kaluuya the lead actor has played his role to stupendous perfection i remember having seen him play emily blunts fbi colleague in sicario but that time my focus wasnt really on him so i had kind of missed out on appreciating the mans ingenious acting talent back then this time though we as an audience are transported into daniels mind and we in a way view the entire film from his characters confused perspective considering how he has conveyed certain emotions in this film we might as well presume that he could be in the race for a best actor oscar nomination next year yes he is that good

daniel kaluuya gave a terrific performance here thought out this film we see this character progress and change and i did care about him in some of hardcore scenes he did a good job jordan peeles direction was good there are some things in this film that kind of reminded me of the way stanley kubrick directed his films from the way the opening scenes were going along i was enjoying it from the way the shots are made and the amazing score it feel like i was watching a horror film from the s the tension and the suspense surrounding this house and this family is very well done and when a character is in danger you feel that danger this movie also knows how to make the comedy pop in movie like this you expect to see the scary things pop out  and this movie does that but also knows how to make the film funny at times and you laugh when you are suppose to be laughing there is not weird sentiment of: we should be laughing or should be scary  the film doesnt do that

that is what i loved about this film but as always this film has flaws i think that the major problem that i have with this film is the tone this film for the majority of it is a suspense movie things pop out weird stuff happens but in the final scene of the movie it feels like a completely different film i not going to spoil it of course but for me just didnt work and i felt that the end of the film was kind of messy another flaw with the film for me is lilrel howerys character in this film he plays a friend of kaluuyas character and he is always talking in the phone and for the majority of the film his character was very funny and howery was doing a good job as this character i felted that by the end is was useless i mean he does things in the movie for sure but he didnt added to much to film beside some funny jokes and thats it i also felted that this movie was a little too long and there are some scenes were chris goes out of the house to take pictures of things because he is a photographer and from that scenes im out there are boring and it doesnt help too much to the film

guys like i said at the beginning of my review i dont hate this movie but i thinks is getting a little overrated the hype and excitement for this movie is putting this film very high and in my opinion it doesnt deserves it my best way to describe this film is comparing it with another film i saw a couple years ago called american sniper that film got a lot of positives reviews got academy awards nominations and it was put as an amazing war film but when i saw it i was kind of disappointed with that film too that is my exact feeling with this movie for me get out is s american sniper is a good film for sure but is not a great one but as always im just giving my honest opinion here if you loved this movie good for you if you hated this movie good for you also all the opinions are welcome here for me this was good horror movie and i had fun with it at times and because of that im going to give this film a ",negative,3
732,732," ok we all know what means to be a racist but this is another story in comparison with this film in fact we watch a movie thats really obvious what is going to happen every minute after minute and thats boring as about the director he seems to think that white people are like monsters and blacks are cool and dudes its really funny how bad and not realistic builds his characters and how predictable the script is in general he does the same thing he accuses white people do bad white people are looking for black servants if this is not a clich√© what really is a clich√© and how stupid is the fact that all the white behave the same white people are not a community in the real world there are good white people and bad white people rich white people poor white people beautiful white people ugly white people and the opposite there are good black people and bad black people rich black people poor black people etc etc in general if you think yourself as a smart guy or girl avoid watching this movie its really meaningless and disturbing and no i am not a member in ku klux klan

733,733," watched this movie with my friend and we had no clue what the movie was about when we entered we just sat in the theater and watched after watching the move weve been talking about it the last  days

all these sensitive people are pretending that the movie was trying to prove something or is insulting to white people the movie isnt trying to prove or show anything its just a movie no one listen to those people who thought it was misinterpreting of white people those people just want to complain about something

the movie doesnt use cgi monsters or demons to make it scary what makes the whole movie scary is that they make every character so awkward and sketchy that it starts creeping you out what i find makes the movie stick with you after is when you realize that everything progressed in a realistic way for most of the movie you dont know whos the real bad guy also the main character knows something is up right away most horror movies are just a repeat of the main character ignoring all the crucial clues to get out you realize the main character did everything he could in this movie which makes the movie seem so real

in conclusion if you just watch the movie and forget about all that stupid slavery and white family talk youll enjoy it",negative,1
734,734," instead of the victims being white women and the sinisters being white men the victims are black men and the sinisters are all white people with the token asian of course

another slam dunk for racism good job

736,736," jordan peels writing and directing were promising i expected a hilarious horror movie which i like a lot or at least according to high ranking on imdb a very good horror movie none of these the first thing ‚Äì this is not a horror movie maybe just a little bit the second thing ‚Äì this is not a comedy either this one is too serious for a comedy there were some jokes but i didnt think the jokes were funny enough im not an american and sometimes i enjoy some little racist jokes in american movies but all of these were so much stereotyped and clich√©d¬Ö according to what jordan peel said about this movie he was inspired by the night of the dead  as to me this was more a poor jango remake pros: acting is very good story looks original that is it cons: its not a horror movie not much of mystery genre here too because its too obvious thriller ‚Äì a little bit not funny some poor pacing writing sucks too much

740,740," this was pretty awful i found myself giggling throughout this movie for the wrong reasons none of the characters were believable especially the family like the father or son  you just wanted to give them a slap but only because their characters were ridiculous it was so over the top it just oozed cringe the main character did not have anything to like about him

that said i guess some people will love it but if you have any form of intelligence you will see its flaws

as for it being a horror movie  there were maybe two jumpy bits in the entire film nothing creative  just a loud string staccato out of the blue to keep your heart at check

the only good thing about this movie was the hot girlfriend played by allison williams i predict she has a great career ahead of her

watch it if you want a giggle  but dont expect anything exciting",positive,7
741,741," i wasnt sure when i saw the trailer it had the potential to be one of two things either a very clever psychological thriller or a puff piece telling us how all white people are evil

im glad to report that its the former this is a cracking film

the set up a young black guy is about to meet the family of his white girlfriend for the first time hes a little apprehensive but she assures him that itll be fine her parents are anything but racist in fact her dad would have voted for obama for a third term if hed been allowed too but when they get there things dont seem quite right its hard to explain why but somethings definitely wrong

daniel kaluuya nice to see an english guy in an american film not playing the bad guy plays chris our poor unsuspecting boyfriend he is the lynch pin to the story everything revolves around him and hes superb allison williams plays rose the girlfriend

if youve seen the trailer youll know that roses family live in the whitest of white neighbourhoods the handful of black people that do live in the area seem to be acting very oddly indeed

this is another film with a small budget there have been a few recently and im starting to believe that some films just spend money for the sake of it sometimes at the expense of telling a story get out cost somewhere around  to make as i write this its apparently taken more than  in the usa alone this shows just what you can do with a well written script some good acting and some highquality production values if you have all that then you have a really good piece of work on your hands there are also very few special effects in this film and those that are used are very simple you could probably recreate them on your phone the film relies on its astute writing and thats a great thing

i was just asked if this is a horror no i dont care what imdb says i dont care what anyone else tells you get out is a thriller and a good one at that there is very little in the way of blood and guts violence its all about atmosphere about a palpable creepiness factor there are points where its actually hard to watch there was also one moment that springs to mind that caused popcorn fly around the theatre but even that wasnt a horror moment it was a great use of sound

the story is a good one the production values are lovely its creepy its funny¬Ödid i mention the humour the interactions between chris and his best friend rod lilrel howery are wonderful they might be a little over the top at times but if you took this situation and transposed it into real life then it would be pretty surreal it would be over the top so oddly those moments fit in beautifully with the rest of the film

get out isnt just chris on his own its also filled with a litany of wonderful performances everyone portrays their character perfectly roses parents walk a fine line between seeming awkward and menacing her brother is an off the wall loon the other local white people are so odd even for rich white people as for the few black people that chris meets whilst hes there wow they would make anyone feel uncomfortable

the score is powerful i cant think of a better way to describe it it adds so much to the feel to the atmosphere the story moves along at a good pace there isnt time for you to switch off or get bored in fact the story is key here you think you know whats going on but things arent quite what they seem even in a film that is based around the concept of things not being as they seem and the film is clever in the way that it lets go of its secrets you find out when chris finds out because of that you really feel a part of the narrative it draws you in

i was worried that this was going to be a film that states that all white people are racist and this is evidence of how far theyll go but its not its so much more than that

i dont want to go into details but there are moments when youre thinking how are you going to get out of this one chris it brings out genuine intrigue it makes you think it keeps you on your toes

i really liked it im not going to do what a friend of mind would do and scream its the film of the year from the highest point i can find but its defiantly up there as one of the best of the year so far at  minutes its not a very long film but like everything else about it it seems just right

this is well worth watching in fact id say youre an idiot if you pass up the opportunity to see it

a wonderful film",positive,10
743,743," holy crap this is a good movie admittedly its been a little while since a down and out great film has graced the screen with its presence and longer still since a great mainstream american horror movie has so effectively clutched the collective pearls of moviegoers across this country thus sounding off on this film might just be the product of being starved for truly awesome content still the nerve of this movie the brazen gargantuan balls of this freaking movie ‚Äì theyre a thing of beauty

those who have glanced get outs chilling trailer will no doubt know the setup a black man named chris kaluuya is brought to the childhood home of his white girlfriend williams in order to charm her uppercrust bourgeois parents she insists there will be no issues though its obvious to chris and everyone else in the room shes being just a tad naive consequently when the couple drives up to the stately family manor on the lake he suspects little other than the usual barrage of forced vaguely racist pablum yet the longer he stays the more chris notices everyone around him seems to be acting rather peculiar including and especially local blacks who behave more docile and compliant than hes used to seeing

using razorsharp social commentary quickwitted humor and good ol fashion suspense get out has all the hallmarks of an aboveaverage turn of the century horror film it balances its blunt themes with a lot of expressive imagery and a consistent tone of protracted offkilter foreboding between catherine keeners hazy somnambulism and bradley whitfords subtle coaxing the movie quietly spins on an ever tilting axis of weirdness every time that spin slows or the films center conflict starts to wear thin were treated to the bizarre showstopping conduct of betty gabriel marcus henderson and a particularly good lakeith stanfield to keep everything headcockingly strange and at the front of it all is daniel kaluuya who remains understated throughout though his smirk cant help but channel sheriff barts in blazing saddles 

the obvious comparison here however would be the stepford wives  which attempted to do for gender politics in the s what get out does for racial politics today the difference here is while one faltered in the realm of active engaging storytelling this movie keeps use glued to the screen from start to finish its escalating stakes and clever little setups and executions become the glue that holds get out together as it wades through the treacherous waters of thirdact fatigue instead of veering bigger and louder like a cure for wellness  does get out keeps its tone and relies on its atmosphere and those sweet sweet payoffs to tickle your brain and keep you invested

and boy is this a tense and engrossing film it aptly juggles all of its various mission statements in a way that is both enthralling and surprisingly polished director jordan peele of key  peele fame slips into the directors chair as if it were a second calling his technical prowess is reminiscent of early shymalan only with narrative twists and turns that feel organic instead of backbreakingly absurd

his freshman film is liable to leave appreciative audiences with a gregarious feeling of catharsis while leaving the rest of us in a state of shock as for me i left feeling i have witnessed a movie about as subversive as brotherhood of death  made by a director hellbent on proving that comedy horror and social awareness are not as far apart as youd think",positive,9
744,744," i just saw jordan peeles directorial debut get out last evening in my local theater and i was blown away by how clever funny insightful and of course unsettling it was it was deliciously weird eerie and clever from the very first scene to the last as i sat transfixed by the events occurring on the screen watching the trailers and seeing the first two acts of the film made me think something quite different from what the film actually turned out to be and i have to commend peele for being able to pull that off so well its rare that my predictions for the twist or finale to a movie are so off the mark

but focusing on the plot itself it follows a young black man named chris daniel kaluuya who is actually british in real life but i never would have guessed had i not seen interviews with him another testament to his incredible acting prowess and his white girlfriend rose allison williams who have been dating for five months and decide its time for chris to meet allisons upper class bourgeoistype parents bradley whitford and catherine keener who live on a large family estate in an affluent suburb this affluent suburb also happens to be the location where several black people mostly men have gone missing for many years vanishing under mysterious circumstances chris is a bit hesitant and nervous because rose has apparently not told her parents that she is dating a black man but she assures him that everything will be fine and they are definitely not racist

however immediately after they arrive chris quickly realizes more and more over the course of his little visit that they may not be overtly racist they do hold certain views towards black people that are a bit odd to say the least coming from a satirical perspective as peele who also wrote the film has stated chris and indeed the audience isnt sure how to take some of the things they say whether or not they are just snide offhand remarks or hinting at something more sinister going on behind the polite cheerful stepfordesque facade in addition to the family itself there are also two black servants walter and georgina who also seem incredibly off as if something isnt quite right in their heads they seem too polite too wellspoken and too white for lack of a better term to chris who nevertheless tries to maintain his composure and hide his true thoughts to his girlfriend and the family in general

unfortunately as chris soon finds out he has every reason to feel paranoid at a garden party another black man who seems oddly familiar to chris temporarily snaps out of his robotic persona and desperately screams at him to get out before its too late he quickly realizes that something is terribly wrong and that his very life or at least his mind might be in jeopardy

i have rarely seen a film where just about every single member of the cast from the main protagonist antagonists and side characters give outstanding performances performing all the little nuances and quirks of their character to an absolute t this definitely includes chriss friend rod lil rey howery who provides most of the comic relief of the film but is also able to carry on the more dramatic scenes effectively also i cant forget to mention the amazing score for the film which is a mix of blues funk and a truly haunting swahili folk song which plays over the opening and end credits

an absolute treat from start to finish and aside from a few clich√©d horror movie moments here and there a true marvel of cinema definitely the sort of film to watch at least twice as once you know the twist you can go back and see the film from an entirely different perspective and all the confusing pieces of the surrealist puzzle fall into place thats all folks",positive,9

grade: b

this film is recommended

in brief: a scary but formulaic horror film that has more to say than just boo

synopsis: an interracial couple visit the future inlaws with disastrous results

jims review: there is something decidedly off from the first moments of get out an eerie feeling of dread and doom that follows its tale to its bloody ending critics have lauded comedian jordan peeles mashup of various film genres calling it a satirical political horror thriller and as the films writer and director he has successfully blended these elements most astutely but in his first feature he still follows a safe formula that has been seen countless times in many other thrillers it is not as original as reported but it is highly entertaining

Ôøºracism is at the core of this film and it is so subtly layered in the writing direction and performances although scriptwise it loses its cleverness around the midway point and the twists and reveals were not so surprising to this reviewer

chris and rose daniel kaluuya allison williams an interracial couple decide to visit the armitage family in the affluent countryside a picture perfect community with no real diversity in sight except for the few black servants who tend to their needs of their employers rose has not told her parents dean and missy bradford whitford catherine keener that her boyfriend is black but assures chris that they are an understanding liberallyminded family he has no need to worry wrong of course

Ôøºparanoia quickly set in as chris realizes that some of the towns africanamerican residents demonstrate odd behaviors and appearances in the armitage household their slightly offkilter sons behavior jeremy caleb landry jones may also be misleading the stepford wives  the most dangerous game vibe is more than intentional as tensions begin to slowly build

get out sends up that welltodo white class privilege and their carefully hidden trump values mr peale doesnt shy away from todays divisive climate and uses gallows humor to make his point his sense of irony becomes grim as the horror elements begin to seep into the plot his direction is skillfully handled as he creates the right atmosphere and rhythm for his film to jumpstart the scares there are plenty of well deserved jumpouttayourseat moments to enjoy

Ôøºthe actors underplay their roles which makes the film more disturbing and effective mr kaluuya is very good as carl he is instantly relatable and his nuanced performance is the major catalyst for the films success ms williams has a nice counter balance as his girlfriend both mr whitford and ms keener two always reliable actors are subtly discomfiting as roses odd parents but the standout performance is given by betty gabriel as georgina who simmers with restrained creepiness as the loyal maid there is also fine support by marcus henderson and lirel howery who contributes the needed comic relief to diffuse some of the tension

Ôøºthe moviegoers in the theater were totally involved extremely audible in their reactions to the action and gore this demonstrative twentysomething crowd whooped and hollered their approval at every killing they applauded numerous times at the bloody mayhem and laughed wholeheartedly at the comic relief sprinkled throughout the film the film made the right impression with its target audience who all shared in the communal tension

get out is a real crowdpleaser but the film is not breaking any new territory as many reviewers have suggested its just a well crafted suspenseful if unoriginal horror thriller which establishes mr peele as a promising director so get out see this film and have some fun",negative,1
746,746," this film should have slaright out to blu ray and dvd i dont understand why everyone loves this movie so good i dont understand i respect people for others who likes this movie thats fine but i am only guy who hates this film a lot because i thought it was very silly writing of film i thought the all idea of it looks and sounds silly like story is written buy group of kids in grade  written this this

is no series film this is like almost like another film with black slavery version modern day of movie called village give me a break this movie  doesnt deserve that high rating whats their to like about it this film  i understand what this is all about but what i didnt like about is just writing and direction the way how stupid ideas i rather watch django unchained black slavery film then this garbage i was almost thinking about moving out of theaters slaright away i knew how bad this movie really was i wish this movie gone out of theaters never shown ever again never existed it gone out to space i will never know why everyone likes this movie the plot: follows that photographer chris washington daniel kaluuya is a african american guy who has a mother passed away from hitrun who knows how  or who did it and i like his character he wasnt pain in butt as character i thought he is likable character in film but i wish it could be a different film for his character chris is going away for a week with

his girlfriend rose armitage family house allison williamsthey go to her family house neurosurgeon dean bradley whitford and psychiatristhypnotherapist missy and her brother jeremycaleb landry jones at the house everyone tries to make chris feel welcome he had good time with family they were kind all that but there is something he doesnt know about family that well anyway there is scene looks so stupid scene with chris and missy on scene when she holds a cup trys hypnotizes him with tea if she stirring it will knock him out what a stupid thing i have ever saw i understand film but the this writing of it i think its dumb it knocks him out if she is stirring the tea what the heck  the stupid scene from movie its so dumb how chris was going to smoke outside then sees walter marcus henderson scene when he runs

towards him then turns right while hes running i am like is that meant to scare me because it wasnt scary away from noting and house butter is georgina betty gabriel i rather watch the purge: election year with her in it i like her character a lot more then this film who doesnt look any scary when she laughs she cry i am like ok i dont understand thats scary none of another characters are good expect for lead role chirs is alright and next day when the party everyone that family knows they had theres guy i swear he dress and really looks like a discount version of pharrell williams he really looks like him the character andre hayworth aka andrew logan king lakeith stanfield the hat he wears i thought that was pharrell williams not be racist have a look so any way everyone who was their are kidnapped brain washed them boo ho the film is slow boring there is noting too it specially there is a stupid scene when chris takes a picture of andrew the flash hits them they have suffered an epileptic seizure first of all they get a nosebleed i am like really who would take a picture of something during the day when there is sunlight its during the day outside chris somehow forgot to turn of flashlight from his phone i was going too say who would take a picture during day sunset its bright day someone takes a picture with flashlight just to take a picture of

andrew in movie scene i am like why dont you check if the flash light is on then you take a picture but i know the movie is trying to be thrilling thats scene when guy says get out i am like roll credits form this silly dumb film ending is noting the ending is so dumb compete this film should have not went in my way i will kick out this film because its gargbe i dont know why this film is shown in theaters whats the fun experience about this film whats scary about this film you have a silly dumb lame twist towards at end i am not going to spoil the movie for everyone or else its not fair because they havent seen it but its just big huge time waster i have wasted  dollars for

ticket i wanted back so badly this movie is not worth for your time get out of it its not really that good the story and writing is not that great its silly when it gets towards it its not even scary some of scenes are just funny but they meant to scare you off the edge of your seat but it doesnt it just wastes your time thinking if you like movie over rating believe me its not that good  director is worst jordan peele actor and director he did keanu worst film of all time now this hits to theaters when you see this movie half way in  get out of this movie get another movie to watch i always wanted to leave theater i wish people got out of theater watched something else but i payed  bucks walk out waste of money and time",positive,8
747,747," get out was a movie that never hit the mark the trailers portrayed the movie had some illplaced humor throughout this humor not only pulled the viewer out of the story but also felt forced and did not add to the plot the movie was not overthetop scary but did had its share of suspense i think the majority of the acting was superb and the cinematography and accompanying scores really set the stage for what could have been a great movie

the movies weakness lies in its storyline the movie propagated the agenda for racial discourse by portraying white on black crime this weak plot never allowed the viewer to become fully engaged this shallow storyline at no point left the viewer feeling satisfied

i think this movie missed its mark entirely it could have been a big hit if the story was more fleshed out with a different focal point i enjoyed parts of it but would not recommend it or see it again i think a cure for wellness which was released a week before did a much better job of engaging the viewer",positive,9

752,752," howd this happen

i dont know how to not spoiler this  rather than dance around the issue inherent in the premise  but for that matter what is it about this movie that isnt supposed to have a charge about it because its social commentary

years after toni morrisons novels first appear years further still after the last poets and ishmael reed etc this is apparently supposed to be an appropriate mode of discourse for dealing with black lives today

i say this because the movies not that much fun it deflates once you leave the twilight zoneesque stuff out and try to look at it as social commentary implausible and it also doesnt stand on its own because it has to function with the thriller aspect or its no go

all early s cinema grappling with black particularly innercitylife existence  good bad indifferent in terms of successfully doing so let alone reception  has lead to this

why is this movie so great

part of it being palatable but not without the quotes around the word is why i feel myself balking at it

cant i just sit here and watch it

the answer is apparently no

i have to think somehow its important

and thats why i cant like it",positive,8
754,754," i gave this film three stars because you have to acknowledge the level of skill that goes into this movie it takes real subtlety in the earlier parts of the film to make a big deal out of every little thing that happens to justify the racebased fearmongering this film is really going for ironically this film is itself very racist but it cleverly sidesteps this by creating a fear based narrative that justifies their racism props to them for that not since goebbels have such effective scare tactics been used of course its still deeply racist so to hell with that

755,755," when the promotional tv spots for this were shown in commercials i dont think i thought too much of it probably believed that the movie wouldnt be so successful given how many horror movies with few exceptions have been failures the past couple years so i was quite surprised to see how big of a hit it became   on rotten tomatoes said one of the commercials for a brief period

still i didnt see it until towards the end of the year on dvd after a long wait on the hold list from the library i went into it as vague as possible  i only knew the basic premise that theres something weird about the family and thats pretty much it i paid as close attention to the dialogue and was along for the ride as chris the main character kept picking up all these offputting things about roses family servants and party guests i also kept wondering if rose knew of her familys intentions or if she was really clueless as we got to the twistreveal as messed up as it was i saw the social commentary in it

the ending i felt was a tad weak i soon learned that it was originally going to be very different if not depressing while i totally understand and appreciate why jordan peele decided to change it to a more hopeful one his original ending wouldve definitely been more impactful this is quite apparent by his comments in the audio commentary

after i finished watching it by myself i was eager for my parents to join me for a second time on the weekend this is one of the few times i bothered checking out the special features  in fact i watched all the deleted and extended scenes and interviews i also love the theme with the eerie chanting that plays over the opening and ending credits and have relistened to it on youtube

my family doesnt understand why love this movie so much i watched for a third time on hbo yesterday and am thinking of buying it on dvd my mom thinks its just because daniel kaluuya is handsome but ive explained its because you pick up on things by seeing it again and thats obviously one of the reasons audiences kept going back to see it in theaters

its definatley a much creepier movie than i initially thought whenever i think back on it another interesting thing is that i saw this just a month after readingseeing my friend dahmer and learned about jeffrey dahmer it shouldnt be a coincidence that dahmer was briefly brought up in this by the hilarious rod he was undoubtedly one of the influences to this story im pretty impressed that this is peeles directorial debut after having only worked on comedy i havent been familiar with him before but now im excited to see what hell do next hes going to work on a twilight zone reboot",positive,7
756,756," the films should have been called white chicks are dangerous plot stupid story even worse i tried to explain what i didnot like about movie but reveiws stoped due to nature of what movies about the best actor was the friend who worked out everything hes like einstien and basically smartest loudmouth in film history the same actor also shines in birdbox and was killed off way too soon in that movie which was a shame the main actor played parking pataweyo in harry enfields show in uk about being a black traffic warden their is no way he should have been nominated for best actor in this film the cup stiring scene was a direct copy from once upon a time in america  but this time its about being hypnotized the film also has feeling of hostal  which was similar to film with women luring men to danger the film also goes against genral thought that old people are racist instead they want to be black a line used in movie its like a really bad b movie comedy that people in holywood think is oscar worthy

759,759," it would be wrong to say that this is not a good film unfortunately one that has been over hyped if i had watched it without knowing the hype and rave reviews it would likely have earned an extra star rating

no need to discuss the plot but the film sits in the mysteryhorror genre slot i thought it was a comedyhorror going in but it isnt in fact the undertone to the film has quite a dark and socially challenging agenda

though is the film a new fresh take on the horror genre as some reviews have suggested well erm no all though there is some astute direction in building the suspense get out does end up following the standard horror narrative the last  minutes is particularly typical as our central character desperately tries to get out of the bad situation

would still recommend watching this film just dont get too excited",positive,6
760,760," hypnosis is what got me into even looking at this its a scientific phenomenon thats completely misunderstood even within the science community and movies dont help in the trailer its clear that this movie is just keeping the status quo of complete ignorance from the media and movies i didnt want to get into specifics because i really enjoy to know them while producers dont so they cant easily fool me but ill do it anyway: knocking someone unconscious by hitting on the head is widely known to be completely wrong cheers

762,762, for some theres really nothing more terrifying than a gaggle of welltodo and overly polite white people in get out or guess whos coming dinner¬Öand possibly never leaving comedianturneddirector peele makes this abundantly clear reminding us that racism often doesnt show up in outwardly obvious hatred but in an insidious need to understand and control the other with breathtaking moments of social adeptness kaluuyas dealings with cops terrifying realizations hilarious satire and even some djangoesque wishfulfilment get out is as refreshingly thoughtful as it is enveloping chris kaluuya  a young black photographer is going on a trip with his white girlfriend williams to meet her parents keener whitford as the weekend unfolds chris becomes increasingly concerned about the intentions and history of his hosts kaluuya is great leading with empathetic concerned but always present and hes supported by some truly amazing actors and characters brilliantly written and executed all confusions  questions are answered without being exposited whats really fascinating though is this is the type of twistinclined horror that shyamalan sixth sense would drool over however the reveal is barely the point instead the focus is on straightup weirdness in visuals and ideas that slowburn from a calmly paced suspense drama into a raucous and insane mindtrip its such a confident debut for peele in the directors seat: the editing and storytelling are clear the visuals are striking but not obnoxious the music is ominously perfect hes clearly studied the masters lynch cronenberg hitchcock and learned to allow his audience to be perplexed by while simultaneously sucking us right in with this and split its already looking to be a great year for horror,positive,10
763,763," get out is an extremely fun film with some very scary parts a great plot fantastic humor amazing acting and visual effects with some fantastic music and it is just an overall fun movie i would recommend this movie to anyone who is sick of generic horror movies that are predictable and boring like me

765,765," usually when a movie is very hyped theres a chance it disappoints you but thats not the case with get out everyones been talking about how brilliant jordan peele is and i have to agree

the very first thing i have to say is i cant believe get out is jordan peeles directorial debut the film show such profound understanding of cinema that many directors dont grasp even though theyve done more films than peele also peeles done some very thorough work i saw this movie last night and im only know writing this review but during this time ive procrastinated ive re realised so many moments and details of this movie they werent details that made no sense they were details that either seemed like just an addition to the story or just the kind of stuff you usually have in this genre the movie itself was completely amazing but the more i keep thinking about this the more im convinced jordan peele is a god damn genius

all the ingredients of an amazing film are here the pacing is amazing so is the build up the story is detailed characters carefully planned and multidimensional the soundtrack is incredible and haunting and it definitely helps to keep you on the edge of your seat

get out also has everything you need from the horror genre the way the story and the horror progress is amazing and close to perfection its just unnerving then turns into something really disturbing then turns into absolutely terrifying all the good elements are there: psychological horror mind control or hypnotism and blood also they have manage to keep the audience absolutely excited during the whole thing

some of the white audience have been angry at the racism aspect though but it shouldnt be hard to understand why the white people in this movie are so terrifying

get out is absolutely brilliant movie and without a doubt the best horror movie ive ever seen",positive,8
766,766," potential spoiler alert

i will start by saying that the lead was excellent however my daughter and i left the film feeling decidedly meh

after the hype we were expecting a cracking and different horror or at least a good psychological thriller but other than a few shock moments at the start the film just did not follow through

it felt very derivative particularly the stepford wivessinister community motif used for the majority of the film and the explanation  was somewhat rushed

sad to be less than enthused but it did not tick any boxes for me

this was neither a good horror nor a clever psychological thriller and im not sure where the hype originated from a waste of a good cast",positive,8
767,767," get out is one of the best movies i have seen in years i see many movies and i go to be entertained get out was a great blend of humor thrills twisted plots and a few hidden meanings dont let the trailer full you it isnt too scary just an occasional eerie moment but no monsters

i was pleasantly surprised at how this movie was put together sorry i am not a educated person at seeing qualities and genius in films beyond what appears on the screen just know this movie is worth the ticket price some of the reviews i read before attending the movie made political references to the story but they were making more of it that they should have

realistically i dont think i have seen a film like this before

769,769," jordan peele has a future as a writer director so expertly does he navigate genres in get out that im struggling to come up with one descriptor rather i want to put them all in a stew and hyphenate: horrorcomedysocial commentarypsychological thriller

young black man chris daniel kaluuya goes for weekend with white girlfriend rose allison williams to her parents home way out in the woods the scary tropes are all there including strange servants and wacky psychologist mom katherine keener all overseen by equally offcenter neurosurgeon dad

if you mash up guess whos coming to dinner with stepford wives and add a dash of freddy for scary laughs then youll understand my enthusiasm for this first effort by an entertainer now firmly right behind damien chazelle for young promising filmmakers

enjoy brains tossed in a trash bucket and wildlyinappropriate social comments comments that at the same time as the humor allow peele to draw on the absurdities of contemporary correctness and social engineering no social hot button about the place of minorities is not pushed albeit superficially but in depth for a horror film

now i know why i was so disappointed in the recent split directed by m night shyamalan: his horror flick was aiming for the expected twist without finesse and understatement get out is assuredly aiming at the incendiary interracial flash point while it attends to issues of conformity and mind control in contemporary society

this film however never loses its sense of humor when it regularly lards the narrative with cell phone conversations between chris and his shlubby buddy rod lilrel howlery its hilarious use of ethnic humor to advance the plot and provide comic relief from the considerablyscary goingson i havent laughed as heartily as this in a long time

as amused as i was with peeles virtuosity i was perplexed that such a fine genre buffet as this should be released at dumpingground movierelease time surprisingly as well i have not been as vicariously scared in a long time perhaps because stripped of its horror and humor get out is also about us all with our private prejudices fueled by our need to control others when we cant control ourselves

772,772," overview: chris daniel kaluuya is invited by his girlfriend rose allison williams to spend the weekend at her parents estate this will be the first time chris has met them and is nervous how their interracial relationship will be received something rose has not warned her parents of when they first arrive chris takes note that both the maid and groundskeeper for the family are black however roses father dean bradley whitford assures him that there are no racial motivations even more odd is her mother missy catherine keener who practices hypnosis despite chris decline for a session she performs it on him anyways

as the weekend gets underway the family hosts their yearly party with friends all of whom are white chris is growing uncomfortable as it seems everyone is trying way to hard to seem like they arent racist they bring up liking barack obama tiger woods and even make remarks about his physique he is surprised to see one black man and attempts to chat with him to ease the awkwardness but finds the young man to be just as odd as the rest of them chris finds comfort in a phone call with his cousin rod lil rel howery who swears something sinister is going on both he and his cousin continue to grow in their paranoia as they piece together the strange happenings

thoughts: for this horror film the scares are subtle tricks played upon the audience it follows more of a psychological thriller pattern avoiding unnecessary jump scares or relying on gore to aid its story there is an unease that follows you throughout the film as you try to dissect each character and what is truly going on its full of tension and continually plays with your mind there is also a wonderfully unsettling visual representation of hypnosis that this film utilizes for when chris is incapacitated it was reminiscent of the twilight zone and it was an interesting way to show the helplessness one could feel

not surprising was the amount of great comedic moments in this film there were much needed moments of levity throughout most delivered by lil rel howery use of humor were at times when it felt natural and it wasnt an attempt to overpower the film or its message jordan peele has found so much success in comedy which was why so many were shocked to hear he was directing and writing this film this was a nice way for him to merge his love of horror with what he is best known for

also worth its own praise is the amazing performance by daniel kaluuya many will recognize him from his appearance in the black mirror episode fifteen million merits his portrayal of the emotionally scarred chris was such a welldeveloped character in a genre that sometimes forgets how to do that

tackling racial issues in a horror movie seemed to unnerve some people when the trailer initially dropped it was easy for people to judge it on the surface especially for a topic that makes some people uncomfortable without getting into spoiler territory not only is the subject of racism addressed but also the idea of genetically superiority as well as life the film is not so easy to dissect and is really a fun one to watch",positive,8
773,773," i take devilish glee in making people uncomfortable  jordan peele

sir you succeed no room for sugar coating as jordan peele did not do so in the slightest in get out this film may be one of my favorite films in the past decade and maybe ever again one of my favorites not all time favorite calm down this film was so brilliantly done from performance to story to the meaning behind it all to the twists just everything i think what i truly loved about all of this is the originality behind it all jordan peele wrote this and directed this as it may have a few nods to past films which cmon what film does not take or at least nod to a past film it ultimately left me so satisfied to witness such a creative horrorthriller another thing this film did so brilliantly was keeping the audience curious until the very end although some things could be predicted i personally still sat there thinking what in the f is going on what are these people doing it is almost as if jordan took his dark comedic skits from key  peele and eliminated the comedy and let the dark vibe of it run wild lastly the performances applause all around to everyone involved i hope to see some of these actors and actresses in more projects in the future i received a very strong robin lord taylor oswald cobblepotpenguin in gotham vibe out of caleb landry jones and could foresee him taking on more villainous roles in the future betty gabriel has been a favorite of mine with her involvement in the purge films and seeing her involvement and performance in this film just reinforced that favoritism tenfold daniel kaluuya is a starinthemaking absolutely loved him in his main role last but not least lilrel howery stole the show no matter how dark get out got lilrels scenes are when the film takes a breath in the form of laughoutloud comedy brilliant performances all around

i had majorly high expectations for this film since i first saw a trailer for it and impressively they were exceeded a horror flick from the mind of jordan peele see this folks it is a good one

774,774, i wish more horror films were as relevant and smart as get out the movie feeds off a paranoia that the majority of the united states population doesnt experience on a regular basis fake smiles and awkward handling of racially charged conversations are masterfully put on display in the first half of the movie the cracks in the white facade intensify at a steady pace uncomfortable questions or points start popping up in the viewers mind what is up with the eclectic decor explicitly called out why are all the black caretakers acting white on the property are we as white people really this ignorant in short you start to feel an entire system is out to get our protagonist admittedly an early scene explicitly sets the stage up mainstream horror films play it safe with the usual jump scares and gory imagery to be sure get out sports a fair amount of both elements at some point all too shockingly familiar racism starts to out scare the traditional horror clich√©s unfortunately several dumb horror tropes also make an appearance for example you have that one horror scene where you have an odd figure chopping wood the others tropes i could list involve spoilers the acting is consistently top notch from all involved i only have one minor quip with the casting choice of a peripheral character the character certainly sticks out when you notice him and the inclusion is somewhat puzzling overall the subject matter more than makes up for get outs very minor shortcomings how often do movies aimed at a mainstream audience have the audacity to call out whites in america the timing of the films release is sadly impeccable racism is alive and well in our country america smiled when she elected trump as potus i congratulate jordan peele for his impressive foray into directing the film is dense and i certainly missed a few points on my first viewing,positive,8

780,780," a measured and endearing enough beginning as a couple proceed to meet the parents the fact that she is white the family wealthy and he is black shouldnt make any difference should it he is aprehensive and we understand and to some extent share his concerns especially as she seems not to have any similar concerns this is where we are already sensing something is wrong but when things turn weird at the house we rather relax into the notion that this is going to be a horror story maybe based on the guys paranoia well this goes way beyond that into society and stepford wives territory but always with an element of race this becomes more and more pronounced until the film is about little else and the audience is set up to cheer the death count of the white folk allison williams is a real discovery and will surely go o to greater things and the director too clearly has skills but that chip on his shoulder and a liking for racial humour may hold him back

783,783," i came into this movie expecting something to be pounding racism as the main theme i expected it to just be about racism and how certain groups of people want to go back to the days of slavery it didnt hit racism in a way that was meant to make people feel uncomfortable the remarks about racism are more common themes and not the point of the movie i dont want to spoil the movie as the overall plot is interesting just this movie being primarily about racism would likely keep many away from it it does have themes involving racism but that is not the primary objective of the movie as far as i can see

the movie has a slow build but really picks up around an hour in the build feels justified at the end theres a particularly comical character that is scene more and more as the movie goes and steals the show towards the end the plot twist is particularly interesting as its not quite what was expected and yet seems like a reasonable twist

789,789," captivating spellbinding and well directed  these are not the adjectives generally associated with american horror movies it is a genre which is now suffocating under the sheer volume of silliness produced every year a genre so muddled by clich√©s that it is not worth watching even for casual entertainment and that is why get out stays as an genre defying exception the debut feature by jonathan peele uses every genre tricks available  but does so cleverly that they become part of the cinematic language and not just thrill seekers staples

get out works at multiple levels on the outset it is a horror movie it builds up the suspense masterfully adds a well anticipated twist and ends with just the right amount of gore but then in the narrative it becomes a social critique there are moments when it becomes psychological thriller and makes you really uncomfortable at times it pays homage to genre stalwarts like the clockwork orange but the very next moment it takes a turn towards a sociopolitical satire and it does all of these with such an agility that the audience never loses the connection with the proceedings there is a hero to sympathize with  but the other characters are masterfully played the movie hints towards an underlying psychology of hatred which is very relevant in todays world

get out is an absolutely recommended watch for the movie lovers such a genre defying movie is very hard to come by",negative,1
790,790," when donald trump asked blacks during the campaign what do you have to lose he didnt exactly have in mind the circumstances envisioned in jordan peeles highly original breakout film get out if you think that the story of a white girl bringing her young black boyfriend home to meet her parents in an idyllic rural setting is going to be a romantic comedy think again influenced by such horror films as rosemarys baby and stepford wives get out has some romance in it and some comedy but they are all wrapped in a twilight zone basket of social satire horror and science fiction that adds up to a rollercoaster ride of dizzying proportions

peele a former comedy star whose show key and peele was an emmy awardwinning series on comedy central has said that he would consider his film to be a social thriller a genre he describes as one in which the horror is embedded in the way people interact the way people think the way people categorize more directly he has fashioned a look at the unconscious racism that may lie beneath the outward appearance of polite society the film opens with a black man lakeith stanfield walking alone on a suburban street in a white neighborhood who is assaulted and thrown into the trunk of a car by a masked assailant a reminder of the recent murder of trayvon martin

the scene then shifts to new york where chris washington a young africanamerican photographer superbly performed by british actor daniel kaluuya is planning to travel with his white girlfriend rose armitage allison williams to upstate new york to meet roses parents though rose admits that she has not told her parents that chris is black she reassures him that they are openminded and supporters of president barack obama who would vote again for him if he could run chris and rose have terrific chemistry together and appear to be on the same wavelength in their outlook on life

their trip proceeds without incident until it is interrupted when they hit a deer crossing the road and have an encounter with a police in what looks like racial profiling the officer asks to see chris id even though he wasnt the driver but rose forcefully intervenes in his behalf a shadowy portent of later events chris feels welcome in the home of roses parents bearded physician dean bradley whitford and psychiatrist and hypnotist missy armitage catherine keener who both say the right things even though somewhat awkwardly dean tells chris about his father losing an olympic qualifying race to jesse owens and missy invites chris to let her cure his smoking habit with hypnotism but he senses that all is not right

his antennas go up further when roses brother a martial arts enthusiast caleb landry jones returns home and immediately challenges chris to a jujitsu contest things take an even more strange turn when he encounters the armitages zombielike black groundskeeper walter marcus henderson and housekeeper georgina betty gabriel when elderly friends of the grandparents arrive at the armitages for an afternoon garden party all white except for an older japanese man and a younger black man stanfield chris is taken aback by embarrassing comments about chris physique and sexual powers and the only black guest suddenly becomes aggressive and threatening

feeling stressed by the unfolding situation chris calls his best friend rod lilrel howery a tsa officer who offers some needed humor but also has an unerring insight into what is taking place at the armitages the reveal in the last part of the film is too delicious to give away but it is recommended that you fasten your seat belts for a wild ride get out is a highly entertaining thriller that will keep you enthralled right up until the last minute while it does have some social implications that is up to each viewer to sort out according to peele the film isnt meant to alienate white viewers so much as let them see this experience that weve black people been living through although perhaps the rich white liberals in the film are an easy target and depicted as caricatures peele says that he wanted the movie to reflect the racism that exists in all of us this reflection is also a mirror of the fears that exist in the hearts of black people who must carefully navigate the racial divide every single day of their lives",positive,10
792,792," the first thing that stands out about get out is its direction jordan peele is the true breakout star of this film he brings an ingenuity and a grace to his direction giving us a very well rounded movie we have fantastic moments of horror which were terrifying we have brilliant moments of comedy which were hysterical we have excellent moments of political commentary which were thoughtprovoking peele is able to pack so much into one film and is able to balance it all with perfectly measured ratios as if hes been doing this for years not every director could go from a moment of pure horror to a moment of pure comedy in a second and peele is able to do this without it feeling forced he was also able to build incredible tension and atmosphere which is not something a lot of horror movies do these days they just go from jump scare to jump scare but peele was able to craft this incredibly tense atmosphere that allowed the elements of horror to breathe naturally

all the black characters are solely filled with positive attributes all the white characters are nothing but negatives if the roles were reversed thered be a huge outcry but of course in this day and age noone would dare to make such a movie

get out is just the latest of a long long line of antiwhite movies enjoyed by the regressive left celebrated by socalled critics whod not dare to speak poorly of this movie and hyped by the plethora of antiwhite poc

the thing is: i bet that with every movie like this there will be more white people waking up to what the media is doing more people will see the blatant double standards more people will get sick of the ruling narrative the pendulum will inevitebly swing back do you really want to fuel a race war because with an endless tsunami of racist stuff like this a race war is exactly what youll fuel i am sick of it

815,815," sorry but all this obsession with racism in every corner is not prototype nor something viewers enjoy rather using stereotypes and clich√©s and being racist against specific people who you consider not too progressive not too open not too identical to the mainstream so the obsession of antiracism turns out to be racism itself making specific minorities to feel more angry for any past disputes and targeting specific groups of people by those minorities and by many more the movie tries so hard to point out this issue that in every corner you see or hear stereotype racist comments concerns bad behavior always coming from the whites so in the end the movie succeeds just the opposite to make people deal and feel either bad or angry with one another not a good movie too bad because this concept could have been used differently succeeding in a much better result without insulting anyone and being more realistic not recommended

817,817," sick movie sick sound track the music contradicts the circumstances in the early scenes perfectly everything seems cool but you as the audience know there is something fishy going on you cant put your finger on it just yet and neither can the protagonist you feel his frustration building as he fails to explain the incongruencies to his girlfriend he wants to get out but he has to go through this if he wants the relationship to progress the internal struggle is real and when sht gets too real when more knowledge comes to light its too late for our friendly protagonist

the way he gets sunk in sunken to all the non sense is pretty original the scene that visualised what was going on in the characters mind was excellent as he falls deeper and deeper and his vision of reality slips away on the edge of your seat the whole way the acting is excellent from all members of the cast the movie fulfils its thriller genre but also delivers some  out of  comedy moments all in all sick movie  stars would watch again

824,824," i was hoping to see a thriller at least it is not a real horror neither satire not even close

the director beats around the bush although the whole story could be packed in a shortcut he was so carried away by the theme of racism that he forgot about directing and screenwriting as such

the idea is not bad but everything that went beyond the scope of the synopsis not worthy of so much attention and it has  nominations such a reaction to the film from the public is very similar to the way guests reacted to chris at the armitages party it is a badly acted lie

writerdirector peeles satirical horror film is incisive thoughtful provocative discomforting flatout entertaining one of the best feature film debuts in years story follows young black man kaluuya traveling with his white girlfriend williams to meet her folks but something is definitely off with not just her family but the entire situation a nearperfect balance between that which arrests and that which unsettles keeping the audience fully invested in whats happening primarily through humor character development and the turning of the plot screws while also putting them on edge and squirming in their seats even if one goes into the film completely cold there arent too many surprise revelations and the buildup is better than the payoff but its that rare instance of a movie based around twists and suspense and toying with audience expectations that actually improves on the revisit plenty to think about and unpeel and study at different angles details and asides that can be missed the first time around also added sunken place to the modern lexicon which is always on the lookout for the latest buzzword to mishandle and dilute

yes i had to laugh about that too putting silliness aside because this can also be considered as dead serious horror but also as relevant socially speaking and entertaining so while the movie delivers stereotypes and plays with them it also shows things that are lying there  some are in the open others are more hidden still racism and discrimination is a thing  why not have fun depicting it and hopefully learn something from it

chris washington afroenglish daniel kaluuya is an africanamerican photographer with an oldmoney white girlfriend allison williams who goes to her weird parents country place for the weekend get out says his buddy lilrel howery over the phone whos minding his dog but chris cant or can he should he whats wrong with all the black people in this house its all good until it isnt

the great thing about get out is that it creates its own logical universe and sticks to it theres a reason for everything that happens including how all the characters react and it all makes sense within the movie its also refreshing knowing and funny in its treatment of the guess whos coming to dinner angle with a lot of er black humour

my fave is where the buddy goes to the cops to explain that chris has been missing for  days i wont spoil the joke

as well as good jokes there are excellent shock and suspense moments too its a wellpaced quality movie and theres some class acting turns it puts a modern racial angle on a pretty traditional horror scenario but it does this very well indeed

ultimately its an oldschool thriller with a social twist and the gore and violence levels pitched perfectly enough to make you cringe but not to make you retch also includes things to think about and things to laugh at",positive,8

846,846," ill admit that im not a fan of horror films the fact that get out  was released in that weird horror month of february that merely exists so people trying to catch up on their oscar nominations dont have to watch anything new meant that it mostly passed under my radar when buzz about the movie continued for the rest of the year i was still skeptical as horror has been known for its cheap tricks and gratuitous violence both of which i dont particularly care for the trick is get out is certainly a horror film but with the minimum required trappings to be considered one

with a few jump scares and a violent and bloody ending get out works on a level thats best described as blatantly subtle its not so much that it screams about the racial differences between black people and white people but that it does so in a way thats almost natural and unnoticed so much of the movie highlights some of the weird and eyerolling habits and likes of white people that youd likely miss them if you blinked of course this highlights the terror of the premise but the comedy in this film helps to break up these moments with some levity to give the audience a break

even though i was aware of the premise and some of the major plot points before watching get out i was still surprised by how everything connected the strength of the plot is held together by a number of parallel themes and motifs that give the audience credit for paying attention and seeing how they interweave with the characters past and motivations people have praised neophyte director jordan peele for this piece of work but i think he just saw the formula for this type of movie distilled it down to its fundamental elements and made it something all his own

a smart thrilling and poignant film breaking through the same old business in hollywood i give get out  stars out of ",positive,8
848,848," it is a good film but im not sure why people love it the way they do like it is a social justice thing or something ive heard everything from conspiracy theories about body organ harvesting to warnings about interracial relationships and nothing appears to come close to a true understanding about what the film does and that is merely to provide metaphors for deeper issues about race what those are is totally up to you to decide what disturbs me is that people want to take the film literally and the absurdity of what we see in this film suggests at least to me that the film was never meant to be taken literally

i almost wonder if people are actually watching the sketches from key and peele and enjoying them for the social commentary or if that aspect goes completely over their head the fact that were looking deeper into anything they do or try to figure things out suggests that the joke is on us if anything i love the film because it successfully trolls people looking for something to validate whatever theories or micro aggression they may have it is not a question of whether the film is the truth about anything so much as it is a consideration about why were looking under pillows and mattresses for confirmation about the complexities of race relations that we already know too well

watch the film yes things are not always as they seem but that isnt the point the point of it is that you want things to be what they are not but what are you going to do about it once you come into the realization of what it truly is and who is to say that youll never do it all over again",positive,9

882,882," no doubt the lead actor daniel kaluuya who plays the african american boyfriend named chris washington was a stand out and well deserving of his academy award nomination for best actor chris who is going to meet his white girlfriend named rose armitages allison williams parents at their home for the first time doesnt know what to expect on his first overnight stay and neither does the audience

this film bares little resemblance to the classic  comedydrama guess whos coming to dinner starring spencer tracy sidney poitier and katharine hepburn which also has the african american boyfriend surprising his white girlfriends parents over dinner at their home the comparison ends there

actor daniel kaluuyas facial expressions are priceless and i give him kudos for carrying this films quality performance more than the seasoned actors bradley whitford and catherine keener who play rose armitages parents i also thought actor lil rel howery who plays rod williams as chris washingtons long distance best friend and advisor was the perfect opposite of the frantic chris washington the screenplay reminded me a bit of the original  the stepford wives in the vein of being brainwashed and under someone elses control

my only disappointment was the ending was a letdown compared to the other  percent of a very good screenplay overall i give the film a respectable  out of  rating and it is worth watching",positive,10
884,884, this picture honestly came out of nowhere because who would expect from jordan peele a man who was kneedeep in comedies and humorous yet of poor taste comedic duos would write and direct this visionary picture get out is by far my most favourite horror film a classy film that does not rely on cheesy jump scares and completely irrelevant stories it is a film that raised the bar of great scary movies and transcended to a high artistic level utilising the power of cinematography dialogue soundtrack symbolism and acting to crate a gem  a movie that sends shivers down ones spine without any kind of conventional scaring technique  first of all this movie is a directorial triumph with a scent of classic tarantinesque vibe and subtle foreshadowing and clever writing jordan peele took hollywood by storm with his first and original work featuring an ensemble cast of both new commers and more experienced actors photographer chris washington  portrayed genuinely by daniel kaluuya is an africanamerican photographer who has an interracial relationship with white wealthy southern girl rose armitage  depicted by allison williams and is obliged to meet her apparently opened family but after experiencing multiple incidents inside the familys residence it is clear that the armitage family has other plans for the poor chris the great amount of fear and plain confusion that chris feels during his visit is beautifully screened by the incredible and oscar worthy performance of mrkaluuya  this added to the intimidating and honestly anguishing performance of catherine keener added more depth and creepiness to the already shocking reality conveyed by the theme of the movie itself  another crucial element in the success of the movie is the brilliant use of camera angels: the movies is a collection of perfectly shot and unsettling scenes that gave this movie its originality and granted its success get out sets itself apart from its peers giving more importance to writing seen in the wellcrafted screenplay and vivid performances of its cast making the audience clench to their seats in both awe and fear but what made me love this picture so much was how visionary the overall directing was how much importance was given to the smallest details in the film to a point in which you will always miss something in the first time you will watch this movie another important aspect of this movie was its noble cause or at least is noble message the entire movie is an allegory of the racial state of some of americas communities especially towards people of colour get out recaps rather brilliantly what has been said multiple times in many significant hollywood films but this particular picture meant the most to me because it made itself as a work of art in the process: this mesmerising picture is going to be the best start for a staggering career for the ascending director jordan peele,positive,10
885,885," id been postponing to watch this movie for a long time not having found any interesting movie as i wanted finally i decided to see if its a good movie as much as the people say at first i thought that it was going to have a cerebral scenario but it does have a very straightforward one

as you now daniel kaluuya was nominated for oscar but he didnt get it i didnt think he would anyway but i have to admit that he remarkably acted well you can feel the emotions and anxiety through his eyes im a bit surprised to see his unexpected performance

the scenario is achilles heel the movie was relatively short and this may be the main cause why you feels so empty when the credits begin to roll i dont want to give any spoiler but the less expectation you have the more joy you have is how i can summarize the movie",positive,10

in the world we live in where people should feel bad about being born white they make a movie like this making whites people out to be the racist ones the critics and fans of this movie are all clearly extreme leftists and it has not been given a fair review

this movie could not be more relevant or necessary in the trump presidency in which we find ourselves if for nothing else than to discuss perspectives on race and perception

894,894," this is a slightly better than average horror film i suspect that overinflated expectation probably doesnt do the film any favours hyping it as particularly new or original doesnt feel warranted to me there are several similarly themed films and certainly several similar feeling films maybe it has attracted an audience that wouldnt normally watch this type of film it is reasonably welldone for what it is many of the criticisms i have i would forgive of horror films that carry me along with them they stand out more with this because it didnt pull me along with it as much as it should it didnt build tension much at all for me it didnt really have me rooting for anyone or questioning things it just didnt grab me very much

there is a lot of talk of race around this film is this a blackwhite film that divides on those lines do i find it racist if the blackwhite characters were reversed would it be racist is it rebalancing previous racism by turning it on its head does it really matter are people taking it too seriously race is obviously an issue in the film but presumably to prod the audience a bit  it doesnt feel preachy it is noticeable that all the white characters are devious manipulative and unpleasant but it is a relatively small number of people within the world of the film all the white characters are bad  thats ok  it doesnt have to mean all white people are bad unless you want to deliberately generalise beyond what the film does

leaving the whole blackwhite thing to one side  ultimately it is meant to be a horrorthriller maybe with a bit of oldschool scifi thrownin that is not too serious is it entertaining yes moderately is it something ive never seen before in some form no it isnt an  but neither is it a  or  imho overall i think  or  feels about right  it is watchable a bit better than average for what it is but not any more than that for me",positive,10

898,898," get out is a great movie that has arguably been over bloated from media and may not deserve all the credit that has been given i would definitely recommend watching it if you havent the movie is a suspenseful masterpiece that left me clawing at my chair but it loses its edge completely on the second watch

theres a lot to praise this movie for noteworthy acting complementary score that throws back to the masterclass of horror great addition of comic relief from the main characters best friend of course the comedy would be great with jordan peele at the helm and above average cinematics

now the bad the movies writing falls a little flat most all the interactions between characters feel unrealistic and forced the story leaves nothing to the imagination laying everything out in front of you with foreshadowing that a blind art dealer could see the entire movie steers you to believing youve got it all figured out when they unveil the big twist and finally explain the entire plot it feels unnecessary and majorly overboard

with all that said definitely watch this movie once sit back sink into your chair turn the lights off and turn the volume up",positive,6

900,900," i was a little apprehensive going into this movie because of the rave reviews and awards nods it has gotten since its release i tend to find that kind of hype accompanies two different types of film the first being a great film whilst the second being a poor overhyped film which just captured the zeitgeist and got critics drooling for no apparent reason

im happy to report that this film sits right in the middle its an entertaining lowish budget horror with strong mystery and suspense elements peppered with just enough comedy not to take itself too seriously if youre considering watching this film and that appeals to you stop right here and go and watch it im sure you wont be disappointed

one thing i will say about this film and the hype around it however is that its mostly unjustified this is a good film a fun film a very wellmade film please have no doubt its just not anything new the biting social commentary id read so much about mostly amounted to using racial tension to create an atmosphere the central denouement of course expands on this but if were being honest here its a very silly message which has been delivered a million times before by much more nuanced accomplished directors its basically society  with added black people

at its heart this is a very fun and silly film with great entertainment value it isnt new it isnt biting and any intelligence it displays is in the craft of filmmaking rather than social commentary

as someone who likes to be entertained rather than preached at i consider this to be a good thing",negative,3
901,901," since the independent filmmakers of the united states presented in  for the first time their award called independent spirit or in its short version spirit when martin scorsese was honored for ¬´after hours¬ª the spirit became the maximum reward of the other cinema of the cinema away from the megaindustry of los angeles in a kind of oscar of the liberated of the hollywood dictatorship from that date the award distinguished good filmmakers ignored by the academy such as robert altman john sayles and todd haynes and many others who later became officialized such as tarantino nolan and aronofsky

to be honest today in  there seems to be not much difference between one cinema and the other: the film that won the spirit for best film of the year is not far from the gore aesthetic present in the oscarwinning film as the best  while ¬´get out¬ª is not as whiny as ¬´the shape of water¬ª but a more forceful and virile drama with some denunciation both films are science fiction products that take the path of extreme and bloody violence to lead us to the conclusion both films also have in common an afrodescendant obese and comical character that plays a decisive role in the plot: in the amphibious fable it was zelda as played by octavia spencer and here lilred howery as rod an airport investigator

in the film a white girl invites her black boyfriend to spend a weekend at her parents house and the poor young man falls into a terrifying intrigue surrounded by sinister caucasian beings and three africanamericans who look like zombies though as charming as the stepford wives little by little the intrigue is revealed although one suspects from the beginning who the villains are  in part due to the stereotyped performances of some interpreters in key parts of the story

they say that the oscar for best original screenplay usually indicates what was the true best movie of the year according to the academy this year this indirect recognition was given to the director and scriptwriter of get out jordan peele the film does entertain and is effective thanks also to a careful soundtrack and very good music by michael abels but if you expect a lot from it you may be disappointed

 ps the garden party reminded me of a similar scene in the stepford wives just as katharine ross and friend paula prentiss are observing the guests so does daniel kaluuya as a matter of fact both ross and kaluuya play photographers and when the nanette newman robot malfunctions because it drank too much wine that is similar to lakeith stanfields epilepsy crisis",positive,6

904,904," this is one of the worst movies i have seen in recent times it is in every aspect a cheap movie with mediocre cinematography and direction at best but with an aggravating script and insultingmeta narrative

the whole point of this film is to insult white people  thats it is a racist movie filled with every cliche and stereotype you can think off to serve as a metaphore for how awfully bad meanies the white race is every scene in this movie is cringe inducing not because a masterfully crafted tension but how presuntuos it is and because of the irony of a movie that is so blatantly racist yet still thinks is making a point in denouncing racism

this is a short versio of the whole script:

see what i did there it is a reference to a meme about race did you get it really did you get it is smart and polemic did you get it because all white people are bad and she is white and she is drinking white milk is symbolic see what i did there but really  did you get how white and bad they are did you get it clever isn¬¥t

this entire film is an insult to the viewers intelligence it is nothing but a very mediocre b movie that tries so hard to be more than it is by pushing for a polemic narrative that doesn¬¥t have a leg to stand on the acting is terrible the drama is weak  is not funny is not scary all the characters are one dimensional stereotypes the direction and script is full of the worst tropes and cheap devices you are already sick of seeing and the fact that this movie is getting so much praise is baffling as is not even good for a tv movie much less an oscar nomination i feel like the world is going mad as i read trough the reviews",positive,7

910,910," i often wish some of the biggest names in hollywood film making would dabble in the horror genre a little more often most have at least one horror credit to their name often from early on in their careers when they were trying to establish them self one name i dream of seeing a horror movie from is christopher nolan that would be undoubtedly amazing get out is written and directed by jordan peele who despite this being his debut film is already synonymous with quality based on his comedic work to date still though the fact that he has made one of the best and most original horror films of the last  years is nothing short of astonishing

it would take me a long time to explain everything that makes get out so great but thats what im here to do so ill give it a go lets begin with the characters its no secret that horror movie characters have long since been a major flaw in nearly every film the genre possesses they are often bland idiotic completely lacking in personality and have terrible interactions with one and other this is the main area i imagine true film makers could improve on things peele proves this to be true by creating some absolutely brilliant characters that i frankly want to see more of even now each character is completely unique and the dialogue they speak has been masterfully thought out and put together even if this wasnt a horror movie i couldve happily just watched these characters interacting for  minutes there are far worse ways one could spend their time

secondly the film is so damn smart theres a very strong mystery element in the mix and the way it is revealed to the audience layer by layer is quite incredible in hindsight constantly throughout the movie we are let in on certain things which will blow you way and every time that is just the tip of the iceberg the clues given to the audience throughout are so crafty and exceptionally conceived that i truly have trouble believing this is the work of first time film maker

i wouldnt describe the film as overly scary but it does have you caring very much about the fate of the characters whether positively or negatively in a world where most horror movies are better than sleeping pills at putting me to sleep i can honestly say i was glued to the screen for the entire run time and genuinely cared about what was happening on the screen

finally not finally but i better not ramble on too long the casting in this movie is the icing on the cake there is not a weak actor in sight in fact on the contrary every performance is tremendous im going to go out on a limb and say allison williams was the strongest of the lot the way she portrayed her characters arc and the some of the visuals she managed to portray will haunt me for a long time get out is unquestionably the best film of  so far",positive,8
912,912," get out: five stars out of five

the new horror flick from writerdirectorcoproducer jordan peele in his directorial debut the film is also peeles first venture into the horror genre as hes previously only worked in comedy most notably on the tv shows key and peele and madtv the story revolves around an interracial couple that visits the estate of the wealthy white womans parents where things dont seem quite right there especially for people of color the movie has been a huge hit at the box office and its also received almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike i think its a modern horror masterpiece

chris washington daniel kaluuya is an aspiring photographer thats about to visit the parents of his girlfriend rose armitage allison williams for the first time hes concerned because rose whos white hasnt told her parents bradley whitford and catherine keener that chris is black yet things are definitely awkward upon meeting the girls parents and they only get stranger as chris meets other people at the estate things especially dont seem right with the familys servants who are both black and they also both appear to be under some kind of possessive hypnosis

the movie is extremely creepy and masterfully directed almost in a classic hitchcockian way its also very witty and full of biting social commentary its exaggerated but it really does make you feel what it might be like to be a person of color in a world ran by privileged and usually quite bigoted white people the performances are all good especially kaluuya in the lead and i think peele has definitely proved himself to be a very talented and quite diverse filmmaker i cant wait to see what he does next and this is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years

but that really isnt what makes this movie good it is the quintessential good horror movie as opposed to the good movie that happens to be horror for instance silence of the lambs psycho or even movies like babadook or black swan instead of attempting the dramaashorror or serious sociopolitical allegory this is classic horror done as well as its ever been done it embraces the hallmarks of the genre without being submerged by them adhering to the classic formula close enough to avoid the mystery label its got its share of blood but avoids relying on it or devolving into torture porn its tongueincheek but doesnt devolve into farce or parody amongst the best of the decade",positive,10
914,914," see the movie and test yourself i mean really as seen in the trailer even i didnt figure it out till after the ending credits there is an ingenious reason for that but youll have to listen carefully to the dialog from start to finish because almost every aspect of this movie including the title has a race based dual meaning depending which racial stereotype one leans toward for instance one may think get out is referencing a racially exclusionary threat toward another race when its actually the exact opposite made brutally evident at the horrific end of the movie

thats the bizarre and clever way these social issues are approached and questioned from a racially sensitive perspective that flows effortlessly throughout the dialog without being obvious a well written script that attempts to make the audience choose what race based lens they interpret the duality of each stereotype upscale white liberals who admire african american abilities and strengths or african americans who view that not as a compliment but as stereotyping it addresses each race equally without being preachy balancing out the humor and racial uneasiness with an unexpected final solution at the end more horrible than the issues created by each races differences

it puts you in it from both perspectives where the humor acts as a release from the unease created from unjustifiable stereotyping by using them as jokes that left me nearly on the floor busting a gut laughing

918,918," im a big fan of jordan peele and keeganmichael key and absolutely loved key  peele and their film keanu i was excited for this film because not only was it directed by peele it was a horrorthriller with some comedic elements pertaining to the subject of race relations its certainly an unusual concept and there arent many movies out there like it

the setup is that a young africanamerican man is going with his white girlfriend to visit her family the acting in the film is strong and the script is wellwritten and very clever through the dialogue peele manages to unpack the baggage surrounding the issue of racial tensions in the united states today the films tone is balanced nicely with elements of horror suspense and comedy despite being marketed as a fullon horror film and containing a couple brutal moments of violence get out isnt that scary however the true intention of peele is not to frighten in a superficial senseit is to create a feeling of interwoven suspense within the story

get out isnt perfect though the film does drag in the middle to some degree after starting off in an intriguing manner and finishing with a riveting climax and ending additionally many of the characters including some of the major ones came off as very flat and underdeveloped but despite these flaws this is an intriguing deconstruction of the horror genre that feels particularly relevant given the current social climate in america ",positive,9

921,921," get out was one of those movies that i personally couldnt tell if it was going to be even the slightest thing toward a good movie i was wrong jordan peele comes out and does a splendid job with get out the camera angles and great work with lighting and display add on to the suspenseful build of the movie the reviews on this movie have been nothing but positive and this one is no different

although not having any big name stars on the casting sheet those to me are usually the best horrorsthrillers the ability to make someone pop on screen and learn about that character just through dialogue is ornately done and makes the conversation roll like rs off the tongue the appliance of social flaws where its jokingly basically white people who say they arent racist but really are is indeed an underlying theme throughout the movie some comedic relief and references get a giggle out of myself and the audience but do not let the name jordan peele trick you into assuming this is purely satire and comedy when instead it is a borderlineflawless thrillermystery

this movies ability to allow us as the audience to fill in the missing holes and piece together the puzzle is something i value greatly out of a thriller being my favorite genre along with horrors and having seen so many it is hard to notch a solid result with that being said this movie hit every peg on my list and impressed from start to finish age:  for grotesque sceneslanguagesome slighted gestures",positive,9

924,924," as a horror movie connoisseur i couldnt get around this movie that has become a surprising box office success has got positive reviews from critics and fans and has developed a hype that might classify it as future cult movie behold the same was said about it follows not so long ago a movie i thought was tedious and overrated as it turns out get out is another genre movie that doesnt deserve all the praise it gets dont get me wrong its better than another paranormal activity sequel and is overall a slightly above average film but it surely isnt the stunning masterpiece most people make of it

just to be clear this film barely classifies as horror movie i would call it a psychological thriller with some misplaced supernatural scientific elements the movie had an overall vaguely mysterious atmosphere but it didnt get scary aside of two minor jump scares involving a deer and a servant

lets start with the positives first of all the movie has a continuously intriguing mysterious atmosphere this atmosphere isnt only supported by the gloomy plot but also by calm and precise camera work that offers a more than welcome alternative to cheap shaky camera stylistics in contemporary horror cinema the movie features a moody soundtrack that blends in without being as eccentric as the insidious scores

a movie is carried by its main character and british newcomer daniel kaluuya is a gifted actor the characters emotions are portrayed accurately you can see how the main character starts as calm grounded and smart person and becomes nervous hectic and confused daniel kaluuya is a name you should keep on your mind because we might see more stunning movies with him i could even see him becoming the next incarnation of james bond

lets talk about the negative parts first of all the trailer is basically the entire movie so dont watch it i didnt even watch it and it still took me less than five minutes after the main character arrived at the mansion to figure out what was going on and what would happen next the fact that the movie is so predictable has a negative impact on its otherwise intense atmosphere the movie fails to offer any surprises to people who are familiar with horror movies

despite a short running time the movie feels stretched when im watching a horror movie im not expecting any action and im ready to wait until the movie quickens up the pace but some elements in the film are either irrelevant or repetitive instead of showing us one scene where specific characters act weirdly the makers offer three similar scenes until the most feebleminded viewer has realized whats wrong with these specific characters a subtle horror movie should take its audience more seriously and offer less redundant clues

this leads us to the acting performances daniel kaluuya delivers a stunning performance allison williams offers a solid performance but the two main characters have no chemistry and fail to represent a realistic couple i could still accept this because that hint might have been intentional what i cant accept is that every single other actor acts overthetop no matter if it suits their roles or not it starts with the main characters hyperactive friend goes on with repulsively rude police officers and ends with an entire family and its friends who behave as if they came from a different planet this acting strategy is repeated to death until the characters have become parodies of specific stereotypes that doesnt fit to a movie that relies on its gloomy atmosphere and intends to spread a message against stereotypes

on the other side the movie takes itself too seriously the scene involving a car accident and an encounter with a local police officer is obviously included as an element of foreshadowing announcing the main characters struggle with his mothers death and with white people with debatable stereotypes however this scene feels so forced and pseudointellectual that it takes away from the movies atmosphere instead of adding to it a very similar thing happens at the end when the writers offer awkward sciencefiction elements appropriate for oldfashioned frankenstein movies but not for a film with such a relevant message when police violence against black people has increased in what is supposed to be the flagship of democracy equality and liberty it seems that the movie makers couldnt decide whether they wanted to offer an entirely serious psychological thriller with relevant social critiques or a clever parody playing with stereotypes in the end they failed at both attempts the movie feels directionless

my guess is that it got such praise because it portrays an admittedly sympathetic black man struggling with abusive white people its funny how a movie that intends to mock stupid stereotypes is itself based upon stereotypes would this very same movie have had the same positive reviews if it had portrayed a white main character being abused by black people im quite confident that wouldnt have been the case because people would have called the makers of this movie racist and the films message debatable this proves that the reason why this film receives such approval is because of its message that is at the pulse of time and yet simplifies a very important topic too much if you take away the movies intentions what do we have left we have an average horror movie

if you arent familiar with horror movies and want to get a smooth introduction with a psychological thriller this film is a good choice if you are rightfully infuriated by the current rise of stereotypes including racism you will get some food for thought if you are looking for a clever or innovating horror movie that justifies its hype you wont get satisfaction my final suggestion is to rent this movie instead of spending wellearned money on a cinema ticket",positive,8
925,925," being known for his half of the comedy duo key and pelle writer director jordan peele seem to be doing something out of his element at first seeing that get out is a horror film but this film has all his markings of his feelings on life that he has done many times over in his comedy

chris is a black dude going out with a white woman who takes him to see her family hes worried about them flipping out when they find out hes black hes got bigger things to worry about

it does have that feel of a key and peele sketch as chris tries to be the only black man in an all white world he hits it on the mark with the awkwardness of dealing with a society who has never interacted with a black person that did not work for them and chris discomfort being the only black person in the house who is not serving the white folks then like all good key and peele sketches the movie ends on an extremely crazy scenario

jordan peele is a genius in the way he was able to create a film that was both a great horror film and funny as hell but not because the horror was campy

you can relate to the social issues of race being handled in the film and its strange because most of it is not met to be funny at all but it connects like jordan is telling a joke on top of that the full story of get out was an great horror story

this is a no brainier it you love key and peele than youll love get out for the same reasons

926,926, its the new movie everyone is talking about and critics are raving about as for me i couldnt wait to get outof the theater guess whos coming to dinner its a black man coming home to a rich suburban white families house for the weekend and despite their black servants theyre extremely nice to their daughters new boyfriend too nice something weird is going on yes something weird is going on only chris washington daniel kaluuya is too stupid to realize it hes so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months that not only cant he see whats going on right in front of his face but he doesnt try to talk to her about it he doesnt try to investigate any of it he just sort of goes with the flow people are raving about this noir thriller when it is one of the most poorly written films ive seen in a while major plot holes aside for the moment there is absolutely no character development no chemistry between the actors and worst of all they dont even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over yes its weird yes something is going on but the writers dont even hint at what that is they dont even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be at first it was interesting and i was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on that maybe chris would find evidence or over hear something but no such luck maybe there could have been a scene without him that gave us some insight there was absolutely nothing until the very end when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didnt make a whole lot of sense without giving anything away they never answer the fundamental question why black people i never liked traditional noir but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of whats going on this film is just one big circle of confusion and to be honest with you aside from some terrific comic relief i hated every minute of it,positive,8
927,927," coming off of the amazingly bad comedy keanu jordan peele has decided to branch out into the horror genre from various interviews that i saw with him he seemed to bring this film out of a very genuine place saying that while it has commentary about racism its not intended to be aggressive or hostile its just things that he has personally noticed so he combined his own personal observations about race relations and his favorite genre of film horror the story is mainly about a black man that goes to visit his white girlfriends parents its very weird typing it like this but trust me this is vital information upon arrival things arent quite as they seem like the tagline suggests just because youre invited doesnt mean youre welcome

shortly after arriving the mom of his girlfriend puts him in a trance of sorts she claims that this specific type of hypnosis is to aid him in breaking his smoking habit a habit that we never see this hypnosis scene is probably the best scene in the entire film and i wish we got more stuff like it the way its intercut with things from his past and how it slowly ratchets up tension using sound is all very well done

thats the thing with this film though its about  good  bad when its good its really good but when its bad its really bad the best thing i can say about this film is that its a strong directorial debut for jordan peele he puts a noticeable amount of effort into this film and its clear that this material is something he really cares about everything looks great sounds great and offers great performances across the board

but this film really feels like a tale of two halves the first half of this film is mostly positive it offers some strange and surreal sequences that do make you feel uncomfortable but at the same time theres also incredibly obvious racial commentary it feels like the idea for the film was created before the story was so we get a variety of great ideas for scenes that dont quite connect to make a cohesive whole

for example the opening scene we watch as a black guy gets abducted as he walks about the streets ok but why was that in the film its not really apart of the main story and doesnt offer anything much aside from a minor set up for later on that we didnt need is it a cool scene sure it is its all shot in one take and does have blatant satire but its a good idea for a scene

and thats the biggest problem with the film it mostly feels like a collection of good ideas that were poorly thought through the execution rarely falters but the script feels like a first draft the main story satire aside is basically none existent but thats ok because theres social commentary to fill that void the only problem with that is the satire is so obvious and so on the nose that it rarely left me with anything to dwell on its always spelled out for you to the point of it feeling like it was hitting you over the head

this is the most frustrating part especially coming off a cure for wellness which not only had a solid story holding your attention but subtle strong political and social commentary for anyone paying attention and you really had to pay attention to see it which is something get out simply doesnt do the oddest part is that the commentary all but evaporates by the end of the film the crazy violent things you expect going in start happening and it seems to completely lose its edge

it turns into this violent quest to survive but and that was great and all but i completely lost any sense of satire which was the only thing carrying the first half of the film its bizarre that the payoff to all this obvious satire isnt anything but mindless violence featuring characters that the film barely bothers to develop get out isnt the film it couldve been its heart is in the right place and it has a good message in there but the message is bogged down by how in your face it is and the fact that there isnt much more to the film other than that",positive,7
928,928," i had a free movie pass and i feel like i completely wasted it on this movie dont get me wrong the acting was good it was an interesting story good camera work and editing

but i couldnt stop yawning throughout the movie i think advertising this as a horror is really a stretch i guess you could compare it to more of a alfred hitchcock horror as opposed to true horror like sinister texas chainsaw massacre evil dead you get the picture

im really surprised at all the  star reviews that misled me here at imdb this was more of a dramathriller if anything the best part of movie was demonstrating how white people trying to not be racist can still be really racist the movie is just saturated with dialogue like i cant be racist i voted for obama or i cant be racist i have a black friend while im not quoting the movie directly you get the idea so the movie scores points for being a good social commentary but as far as horror movies this was extremely slow and boring and a very small payoff at the end

i wish i could rewind my day and see a different movie with my free pass what a waste",negative,1
929,929," have you ever felt out of place at a party perhaps a friend had taken you for the evening or somebody from the office invited you over thinking that their group would click with you i get that feeling a lot a lot of it has nothing to do with the people hosting or the food but ive been more comfortable in situations where i have control without something to latch onto i become that guy at the table whose going to look up something to read on the internet rather then socialize

todays subject deal with that kind of fear that i think a lot of people have when they suddenly feel alone when ironically when there are people it usually has to do when they feel the most different so it does make sense when people of different color are around those not the same thats not to say the people hate this guy but it does express how some communities dont entwine with more a mixed race mindset during these situations i try to make some casual conversation hoping i can find one person to stick to for the rest of the evening thats not an option for our hero in get out

photographer chris played by daniel kaluuya is getting ready for a weekend trip to his girlfriends parents place rose played by allison williams is white while chris is black they seem like a good couple with the proper chemistry as hes packing he does ask whether alisons parents know if hes black she responds no feeling that even saying im bringing my black boyfriend home would seem morally wrong on their way over they hit a deer which prompts a cop to stop after a bit of racial profiling chris and roe finally make it to the parents estate

upon driving in chris sees the groundskeeper whose black he also sees their maid who is also black when chris finally meets her parents dean played by bradley whitford and missy played by catherine keener things seem to go well and both act very nice one the first night over missy uses hypnosis to not only break chris of his smoking habit but manages to reveal personal information he dismisses the hypno session as a dream but faces more of roses family the next day at a party theyre friendly but something about them being over accommodating towards chris makes him uneasy he continues to see just what the family is about in the next couple of days

director jordan peele yes that guy from key  peele has a clear understanding of what makes a good horror movie by exploring ones true fear he takes advantage of the art by not only staging several scenes as intentionally uneasy but even showing the more horrorlike tropes impressively the entire opening sequence is all done in one take with no edits he manages to carry that tone pretty well though it does become slow once thing unravel

the best thing about the movie is daniel kaluuya as chris had i not seen him on a talk show the other night i would have had no idea that he was british i also like that his characters personality seemed like a guy i would run into rather then making him a stereotype he can carry a movie even through the darker parts when his backstory is revealed though i can give away much i can say that this films falls in the same category of the original straw dogs in ones feeling of loneliness in an odd environment

ill give this eight deer skeletons out of ten i dont know if i can call this a game changer but it was still a fun movie to watch i defiantly recommend this for those looking for a good thriller step out of your comfort zone and get out for get out",negative,1
930,930," i was intrigued by the fact that jordan peele  of the comedy duo key and peele was writing and directing a horror film that i decided to check it out  interestingly enough i soon discovered that get out is not a horror film  it is a suspenseaction flick with horror and comedic elements

and it works quite well

following in the footsteps of suspensehorrorcomedy films like the edgar wrightsimon pegg shawn of the dead get out tells the story of chris a young africanamerican lad daniel kaluuya who is dating rose a caucasian allison wiliams  rose invites chris to meet his parents at her family estate  once there chris realizes that something is terribly wrong

written and directed by peele get out zips along breezily for the most part stopping for a moment for a piece of comedy or suspense  the estate is very very much waspy and white bread and all the victims are africanamericans so there is a very real racial element to the story but peele does a good job of showing  and not telling  the inherent racism simmering just underneath the facade of those around him

and these facades are very good  as bradley whitford and catherine keener play roses parents and they bring much more to the table than a typical film of this type might otherwise have  both are congenial threatening friendly and covert showing us layers hidden under layers  stephen root shows up as one of their white bread friends who might be sympathetic to chris  williams does a nice job as rose adding to the tension  only caleb landry jones as roses brother is too overthetop  the rest of the family are nuanced  he is not

but the star of this film is kaluuya as chris  he is the audience surrogate in this film and brings us along in a winning fashion trying very hard not to believe what he is seeing but also slowly and shockingly coming to the realization that something is horribly wrong

adding to the fun of this film is the breakout performance of lilrel howery as chris friend back home  his rod williams is saying out loud what most in the audience are thinking and he is quite hilarious  i cant help but think that peele had this film in his head for quite some time with his partner keeganmichael key playing chris and peele portraying rod for rod has the funniest lines in and is the most winning character

if you are looking for a horror film go see something else  if  you are looking for an entertaining enough suspensecomedyhorror film than get out fits the bill quite well

937,937," this movie is beyond what i could have expected

the writing and direction is so tight and so focused and there is no loose end

the ending was perfect the twists were fresh the soundtrack and cinematography captured this sense of unease that just settles beneath your skin from the first scene to the last

the casting was on point the acting was fantastic the comedy and humor so brilliant i was so delighted to find a horror movie that didnt depend on cheap jump scares and random bursts of sound to drive the story forward

every scene had weight everything came back at some point i mean what can i say watch this film and watch it in theaters if you can or at least in a room full of people everyone in the theater with me was cracking up or making comments and there were about  points in the movie where fellow moviegoers started applauding at the sheer enjoyment and payoff they felt when certain things took place

i will be introducing this movie to many people i know and even if you dont enjoy horror this movie still has something to offer the story itself is what makes this film amazing and the humor is to die for

950,950," jordan peeles oscar winning original screenplay along with daniel kaluuyas powerful performance makes get out a true masterpiece of film it speaks out as one of the best films of  while it flew under the radar

i never saw the trailers for the film and so i never heard about the movie till  i finally had the chance to catch the movie and the film is wellwritten but beyond that its one of the best acted films ive seen in a long long time daniel impresses most of all but its also the supporting cast of marcus henderson betty gabriel lakeith stanfield and especially allison williams that bring the film to life

chris washington kaluuya is the first black boyfriend for rose armitage williams and shes bringing home to her parents to have them meet over the weekend rose forgets about a party that is held that weekend in honour of her grandfather and chris feels uneasy as the party goes on and all the guests act strange

it doesnt take long for the film to delve into the horror aspect when chris goes to have a cigarette we are greeted to hypnotism from missy catherine keener another great performance roses mother makes you feel uncomfortable during the entire scene and you really feel daniels performance in the scene as well

977,977," as this film opens a young black man lost in a suburb is attacked and abducted we then switch to our protagonist chris another young black man who is preparing to meet his white girlfriend roses parents for the first time she assures him that they arent racist but liberal to the point of clich√© once at their large rural home chris soon starts to feel uncomfortable their black maid and gardener seem like characters from before the civil rights era and while outwardly friendly there is something a little off about the family roses mother hypnotises him to stop him smoking but he is convinced that she did something more a party thrown by the family only makes him more concerned but by the time he realises the real danger it may be too late

i found this to be a really effective horror movie even though it features little obvious threat till the very end in many ways i was reminded of the wicker man a protagonist goes somewhere of his own free will finds things somewhat creepy then finally learns a horrifying truth there were also obvious stepford wives vibes with the way the other black characters at the family home and their neighbours behaved as the film progressed the tension was constantly raising and although it was obvious that something bad was planned for chris i didnt guess just how bad until he was told what it was some levity was provided by chriss friend rod who was convinced that rural white folk wanted black men as their sex slaves daniel kaluuya does a really fine job as chris he is rarely off screen and is convincing throughout the supporting cast notably allison williams as rose and catherine keener and bradley whitford as her parents are also impressive writer director jordon peele did a brilliant job it is hard to believe this was his directorial debut while it is obvious that there is a racial subtext to the story it doesnt feel like the viewer is being lectured to overall id definitely recommend this to horror fans who dont demand frequent violence",positive,10

983,983, get out is horror thiller that dives much deeper into a commentary on the topic of race and racism in america today this film does not leave you once you watch it this film lingers in your thoughts well after the credits finish rolling this was jordan peeles debut in directing a horror movie he masterfully and subtly payed homage to classical horror films while still putting his own footprint on the film it specifically pays homage to the stepford wives and night of the living dead the film was casted beautifully and the two actors that stood out were daniel kaluuya who plays chris washington and lil rel howery who plays rod williams this was daniel kaluuyas first major role in a film and i believe that he stepped up and his acting looked effortless lil rel howery was the perfect fit for the movie because he has starred in the role of comedic relief in many movies like: uncle drew and tag next the sound design gives the audience toby oliver and jordan peele work skillfully together to create the images in the film there is an alluring scene where chris is in the sunken place this was very elegant and chaotic at the same time they wanted to create a feeling of the sense of him floating in a black void with the screen above him they achieved this by simulating chris being uracistnderwater while he was on a dry set another great scene is when actor betty gabriel playing the maid gets a close up of here crying and laughing at the same time while the camera was about  inches from her facei would rate get out an  out of  and a must see,positive,8
984,984," an expertly crafted story woven by the meticulous hands of jordan peele with superb screenplay as an added bonus a must see for anyone wanting a genuinely thrilling experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout

986,986," watching this movie the first time was uncomfortable because that is exactly how you are supposed to feel the plot twists were fun and unexpected but became more predictable as the movie evolved nevertheless the movie was clever and the ending was very satisfying

it took a second viewing to really see the genius of the writing the entire movie is one double entendre after another i cant wait for peeles next offering

991,991," the movie is a contemporary frankenstein enhanced with a racial edge it is indeed a horror movie as classified but carries none of the wornout cliches of this genre like an eerie soundtrack spooky settings creepy kids cheap jolts paranormal events all of which test our intelligence and patience because weve seen them over and over again although the main idea is  years old the movie doesnt dwell on it but only makes a passing reference thus keeping its originality all in all this is a brilliantly made movie worth seeing

994,994," as a general rule of thumb i trust imdb ratings to represent how good  bad a movie is but there have been a couple of movies recently that ive seen that have just not lived up to their imdb rating promise and this is one of them never in a million years is this a star at the time of writing movie

first the positives get out was very well acted and all the characters were believable and i was gripped enough throughout to not be checking my phone every few minutes  in that respect its a decent enough movie

i note quite a lot of the reviews here dwell on the racial theme of the film and give it star on the basis that they think that such racism isnt real and the film is simply paranoid my hunch is these people are probably white and thus dont really know what its like to live as a black person in a white society so to mark it down on that basis is a nonsense

im marking it down because it wasnt a particularly great horror movie it was somewhat predictable in parts and i found it a little weird in parts too for example the movie was pretty serious largely  not something you would call a comedy  but there were segments that seemed to jump into jokey wisecrackcomedy territory notably around the main characters tsaemployed buddy rod williams played by lil rel howery those scenes just seemed a little out of kilter with the rest of the movie

i also thought the ending was a bit rubbish

overall get out is a watchable movie but it simply is not oscar material and  on the imdb richter scale is just wrong",positive,6
995,995," get out is an unusual suspense horror thriller daniel kaluuya is very good in his role but must be the replacement for james franco who was odds on favourite for a nomination until allegations of misconduct at the th hour by actresses he had worked with scared off the academy voters its quite a good movie i found the subject of afro american slave zombies slightly uncomfortable and politically incorrect the movie came out may last year so i had to hire it and watch on the small screen and it perhaps would have seemed better at the cinema as all movies worth seeing are but im certain get out doesnt deserve or have a hope of winning best picture best actor best director or best screenplay all the categories of which its been nominated for i have only one question after seeing this movie  why was the director of three billboards outside ebbing missouri martin mcdonagh so egregiously snubbed for a best director nomination when jordan peele managed a nomination for get out which is a good movie but just doesnt deserve any of its nominations in my humble opinion

998,998," on a visit to his white girlfriends parents a black guy finds his hosts have more than just a few awkward moments planned for him 

well paced thriller with some creepy moments and a fair amount of gore but not a real horror the set up is nice and snappy and we settle into a weekend that escalates from social antagonism to outright exploitation the mood is developed through the alienated existence of the weird black characters and theres plenty material on the theme of race but the whole thing is let down by a ludicrously elaborate plot there are echoes of the disturbing skeleton key but this experience falls short by comparison

the performances are solid most memorable being from the actress playing the maid who delivers some genuine weirdness one character designed for comic relief is too deliberate and fails to fit in to the plot at the very end direction and photography are good and the music is cool

overall: well told story but the concept is over the top",negative,1

1004,1004, its very hard to describe a movie like get out without spoiling the secrets or the fun that makes the movie subversively dazzling and audaciously triumphant i even had the decency to watch this movie without having to see the trailer but knowing the premise right away i knew that this was an unusual kind of horror movie one that actually makes us think about ourselves once we leave the theater watching it in a crowded movie theater i havent seen a movie this stunning that made an audience feel uneasy since last summers surprise hit and my favorite horror movie of that year dont breathe the opening scene sets up the premise immediately and then itll come back to you later in the film because of the idea of it is surprising the idea of an africanamerican being introduced to your significant others parents and the fear of suburban life for a black male kicks off when photographer chris the wonderfully expressive british actor daniel kaluuya asks his girlfriend rose a remarkable film debut by allison williams of the hbo series girls before they go to meet roses parents for the weekend: do they know im black she says no but she did say that her father wouldve voted for obama for his third term once we get to meet dean the incomparable bradley whitford and missy the calm and comforting catherine keener roses parents they really do seem like really wholesome parents after a few subtle but very offhand remarks that dean says including that obama line and also about jesse owens you get the sense that something weird is slowly starting to go down even the happy friendly maid georgina betty gabriel the groundskeeper walter marcus henderson and roses brother jeremy a eerie performance by caleb landry jones are acting quite odd even the relatives and friends dean invited are making chris and rose feeling uncomfortable then thats when the shift start to change and chris might need some help for his friend a tsa agent named rod lil red howery a showstopping comic performance to uncover some secrets this is where i stop and tell you who the real star of this movie is this movie of course marks the directorial debut of jordan peele one half of key  peele here he had the audacity to make a horrorcomedy with social themes that a lot of people are still talking about what people should take away from this are the themes of white conservatism how black lives really do matter and how most people ignore the rules of society and prefer to live their lives the way they think they should white its sublimely scary and aside for a brief moment not overthetop gory its wickedly funny as hell most of that humor which peele is known to do on the key  peele show comes from rod especially in a pivotal scene with a social moment interwoven into it when he tries to tell someone about chris situation but no one believes him plus the score by michael abels the editing by gregory plotkin the production design by rusty smith and the cinematography by toby oliver are phenomenally firstrate get out is the first great movie of  it plays its game straight and the movie weaves its powerfully scary spell on you and to my surprise it kept me on the edge of my seat and refuses to reveal its cards to us until the right moment when it starts to get a little queasy for us the audience members and in this day and age we needed a movie like this that encourages us to stay woke something also tells that im looking forward to see what other tricks jordan peele has up his sleeve this isnt the traditional horror movie you always prefer its an original horror movie with a feeling and a savvy social side to match,positive,6

1014,1014," video review here: https:wwwyoutubecomwatchvha grdytmfeatureyoutube

generally horror films in this day and age arent exactly the most congenial of sights for movie enthusiasts from tired old clich√©s to a neverending stream of unsatisfactorily constructed and acted moneygrubbing pgers expectations are set at an all time mariana trench low a silver lining to that is the unequivocal awe when true effort is exerted and consequently a beacon of hope radiates with incandescent luminosity for the horror world that is the case with jordan peeles horror debut get out it had a shite trailer an unoriginal title but it veritably blew me away ladies and gentlemen of the film industry this is how to make a horror film properly

the film starts off with at night with a young black man in a white suburban neighborhood who is abducted in an emphatically creepy manner cut to african american photographer chris washington daniel kaluuya he drives with his white girlfriend rose armitage allison williams to her parents estate they have no idea that he is black roses father dean is a neurosurgeon and her mother missy is a psychiatrist while they are friendly to chris in a rather patronizing kind of way he becomes increasingly uncomfortable when he notices how strangely groundskeeper walter marcus henderson and maid georgina betty gabriel who are both black are acting very strangely we find out that things arent the way they appear at this place

the true genius in this film laid in its virtuosity at provoking laughs unmitigated tension and consternation and most importantly some postviewing dialogue as a result of its blistering social commentary on race relations in the united states that is shrouded in this impeccable concoction of horror and satirical comedy when it came to the way roses dad was attempting to pander to chris with some black words in addition to the statements made by the creepy old white people at the garden party about blacks being in style those kinds of scenes in my opinion served to highlight the subtle racism that may exist among some of the politically correct moreover other scenes throughout the film play on our assumptions whether were black or white about how certain events would play out given the race thats involved in them the overall message is left in the eye of the beholder and thats part of the films beauty its so bizarre it keeps us thinking when was the last time a horror film truly did that

i am so glad that jordan peele chose to keep the jump scares to a minimum instead opting for tension unpredictability and a surreal atmosphere we the audience are just as confused as chris as to what the hell is going on and are equally as freaked out the films ability to consistently scare perplex and amuse the viewer kept me guessing which resulted in some heavy satisfaction to the slightly predictable payoff additionally chris is a character we can actually care about there is a trouble inside chriss mind which i will not spoil that is touched on in a very bizarre but earnest kind of way

it wasnt just atmosphere from a technical standpoint that gave the horror its unprecedented vigor its the performances daniel kaluuyas subtle performance conveyed suspicion restlessness and all out fear with immaculate panache topped with an american accent so spot on that some slight incredulity struck me when i found out the actor is an englishman two exceptionally noteworthy performances were by marcus henderson and betty gabriel the groundskeeper and housemaid respectively georginas zombified behavior in particular is the kind that will give you some kind of paralysis as youre watching her she truly was frightening of course some much needed credit should also go to milton howery who played rod a hardworking tsa officer and chriss dear friend not only was he fantastic in providing some comedic relief a good deal of his hilarious lines brought out some of the films satirical elements a truly lovable character indeed

dont be fooled by the trailer of get out the film is nothing of the sort with cutting edge performances genuine thrills eerie atmosphere subversion of horror tropes and scathing social commentary on race relations in america get out reassures us that originality is something very possible in the horror world no matter how absent it may be from the majority of such films with  approval rating on rotten tomatoes from  professional critics at the time of this writing will get out be the first horror movie in a while to get nominated for an oscar in a major category probably when the audience in your packed theater cheer and clap then you know something is done right truly remarkable i say get out of your chair or whatever it is youre sitting on and get your spindly ass over to that theater pronto

now the movie was good daniel kaluuya is a great actor this is not precisely a horror movie the trailer makes it seem scarier when it actually is just suspenseful and creepy there were some laughoutloud moments of comic relief even though the movie is  minutes it feels shorter the ending was a bit underwhelming but left me content

plot  the idea is ok but the realization is poor why because the build up in the first half of the movie is soooo boring beyond belief and then the second half of the movie is kind of rushed all the killings in the end happened so fast in a pretty simple way without any suspense

cast  the family acted ok but the main character and his friend stole the show for me

1033,1033," there hasnt been one horror movie in the past decade to get the critically acclaimed ratings and reviews as get out as this review is being written get out has an impressive  rating on imdb and an astonishing  on rotten tomatoes those types of numbers scream potential oscar nominations for get out and by receiving this type of notoriety the potential of the horror filmgenre getting to an oscar platform again would be monumental however even before seeing the film and understanding the current political environment in america it is apparent the social message is the primary reason the film is being universally praised by critics

its also clear the best way to view get out is in theaters as it feeds the crowd with a variety of emotions that include laughter intensity and awkwardness jordan peele did marvelously in his directorial debut shooting scenes with comedic value swiftly into serious nerve wrecking sequences peele also have written the storyline came up with a very original concept of a social horror film racial dialogue was constant throughout not subtle in the least with most lines hitting well but there were a handful of duds the cast did great with their dialogue and were well rounded in terms of performances and screen time it seemed supporting actress betty gabriel as georgina really stood out in her role executing it perfectly but daniel kaluuya and allison williams were spectacular in their leads too

possible spoilers ahead the biggest faults in the movie came in the last fifteentwenty minutes when it took a different direction in its plot and drew sharp comparisons to a past horror film skeleton key the very ending was however the most questionable aspect taking the easy cherry route instead of a darker more socially compelling ending there was an opportunity to hit big with the ending but it missed get out is an amazing original movie great for the horror genre and will be cheered heavily for possible oscars however does it deserve the high acclaims it currently has answer is a definite no",positive,9
1034,1034," three and a half stars out of five i deducted a halfstar for the fact that its obviously an amateur production made much better than it should be by some very talented people who have bright bright futures ahead of them all in all a fine effort and a load of fun for people who really dislike typical slasher films because this isnt one

nowadays a horror film can be just about anything including pornography ersatz snuff films and documentaries about the government we all seem to be a trifle more mature now than we used to be and hollywood is throwing everything at us hoping something will stick so its fun and cool when a lowbudget film doesnt just cop out with grossout horror or get lost in politics i appreciate it when the filmmaker actually gives the audience credit for having a brain and using it

the camera work is this movie is seldom bad and often very good the acting is surprisingly good considering that were not talking a list cast here the story is strong enough to keep you guessing and the little touches that make or break a story like this are there

so whats wrong if anything well like a lot of lowbudget thrillers get out begins to lose a little momentum as the requisite creepy buildup begins to change over into the inevitable action i dont think its a spoiler to say that things get more fastpaced as the film progresses its during this part of the film where we begin to wonder just how far over the top were going to gotoo far into thats dumb land or not far enough into thats boring land get out almost pulls it off but in the end we feel that we watched a really good lowbudget thriller not a true work of art that will go down in history on the other hand most people dont like art films anyway seven out of ten",positive,9
1035,1035," another february weekend another time for a horror movie to hit the silver screen tonight my review is on get out a simplistically titled tale that is from the mind of key  peeles jordan peele how well does a film directedwritten by a comedian fare as always its my job to share some thoughts insights and opinions on the latest film so stay in grab a drink and read my thoughts on this epic film

likes: ¬ï good central character ¬ï comedic relief ¬ï wellpaced ¬ï decent story

summary: its always good to have a character you can grip onto if you are going to watch them face the nightmares of this film chris is one of those protagonists that fulfills that role containing all the elements you want in a character: backstory level headed decisions not annoying etc daniel kaluuya is certainly one of the better horror genre actors and portrays his role in a manner that doesnt want to make you roll your eyes outside some emotional flatness the team made him portray yet the other actor to steal the show not based on looks was lilrel howery as rod the tsa rods scenes are purely comedic serving to relieve the tension the movie builds up and keeping it decently integrated into the story these scenes in addition to lightening the mood keep the pace of the movie flowing to avoid that prolonged dragging feeling that many horror films seem to have such a pace kept the film interesting to me by keeping the suspense at a maximum perhaps the biggest strength to me is that get out has a decent story laced with some originality while not the scariest tale to hit the screen this film has some hot topics built into the story primarily racism and its wrongdoings that go alongside the character building moments of the story in addition there is a nice twist to the tale which may please many fans of this genre

dislikes ¬ï high political points ¬ï unnecessary scenes ¬ï not scary ¬ï the ending being a little too easy

summary: while peeles writing is certainly impressive tasteful and clever at times it also falls victim to being overly political for me at times get out has many scenes were the extras throw the multiple judgmental stares the rude overstep their boundaries with too personal and insulting questions or out of the way monologues about skin color that were more eyerolling than necessary its not that i dont believe this issue exists i just grow tired of directors deviating from the cleverness and pace of the story to make a point in these movies another unnecessary deviation was some of the comedic relief moments dont get me wrong rods comedic relief was very welcome and had some of the best dialogue presentation of the film however there were moments where his scenes felt out of place randomly thrown in there where they felt more like an snl intermission than being pertinent to the story guess a comedian cant fully drop his roots his comedic background may also be the reason this movie wasnt too scary either again peele has done the genre justice in terms of making a thriller with a decent plot that has some substance to it but this movie failed to scare me at any point of the film outside of maybe a few creepy stares from the brother or other staff i think peele tried to make it creepier from the realism aspect but outside of that the jump scares were poor the extras presentation was more annoying than scary and the theme of the movie takes a different twist finally when the movie reaches its exciting climax peeles writing definitely leaves you feeling fulfilled on many levels however much of that ending seems to be a little too conventional that takes away from what he built things happen in random succession and there are a few moments where logic and realism are dropped like so many hot potatoes it again becomes more humorous than fun

the verdict:

despite my doubts get out is a movie that stands out in a good way from many of the horror movies unleashed in the last few years i always find value in a film has a good central character that has development and a wellpaced intriguing story to support it in addition while the comedy does have its out of place moments the comedy is also a welcome diversion to make you laugh fortunately in a manner that isnt overly stupid however if you are looking for a movie that will haunt your dreams and make you jump this isnt the movie for you whether it is the lack of scare tactics or the overly political moments get outs horror aspect is highly diluted in this film feeling more like a mystery than anything else worth a trip to the theater im on the fence about this one but i have to say wait on this one until it hits home in a few months

the film is not without its laughs theyre all the bigger for their pitch perfect timing amidst the equally strong sense of unease and dread the combination proves to be really potent and the film blends its humor jump scares atmosphere and social satire seamlessly

the cast is essentially perfect the film is relatively small in scope it lurches maybe a little too hard into genre thrills in the third act and i suppose i think the final reveal couldve been eased into a little more gracefully

1040,1040, i dragged myself to go see this movie because i thought it was going to be stupid or wayans brothers bad spoof from watching the trailer but i was totally taken by surprise this movie mostly drew out two reactions from me one of laughter and the other of fear not like a slasher film like halloween or jason but the atmosphere and music as creepy and haunting as the opening scene from the shining its a different kind of fear the fear of paranoia knowing something isnt right in your gut but you cant prove it because you cant see it but you can feel ill admit i didnt find the leading actor daniel kaluuya who played chris attractive at first and thought hell be a buffoon in the movie but i had to retract those feelings after first seeing his talented artwork in the opening scene his well built body his presence his cute dog his commanding voice and his intelligence all kicked up the attractiveness of this man in my eyes i wont spoil the movie because it is an experience you should witness for yourself the less you know the better even though the movie has rewatchability and its one of those movies that the more you watch the more you discover or pick up on the entire cast was perfectly cast the script was amazing and chris was a smart in how he handled situations he was a smart character that you symphatized with and wanted to succeed and be happy i think everyones favorite character the tsa agent and chris best friend played by lil rel howery because he represented us the audience in the movie and constantly kept us laughing especially when the movie became serious at times jordan peele did an excellent job with this movie its whos coming to dinner meets rosemarys baby meets the stepford wives as the ending credits rolled and i was leaving the theater and stepping back out in the real world i was still creep out and paranoid i love horror and comedy movies but as i drove home i wondered what was it about this movie that creep ed me out it was not scary like a good slasher film but it was the atmosphere the movie created the haunting music and the paranoia it finally dawned on me that paranoia i felt from watching this movie is how i feel like in real life simply being black in the world i found out that jordan peele cleverly made a horror film about racism and turned something that is abstract into something that is concrete as a movie i loved this movie and had a good time watching it it didnt have me on the edge of my seat afraid but some scenes were laugh out loud funny go see it if you havent seen it it is an experience and a movie like this has never been made before it was very risky career move for the actors to make this movie but the risk payed off well and the movie is amazing,positive,9
1041,1041," excellent movie high probability of being the first movie that i will rewatch in theaters bc i realized i still missed some things in the movie even though i was looking for clues since the beginning watch this movie in theaters with plenty of black people in the audience im not black the crowd makes the experience much more enjoyable if you are not the cheering  screamingatthescreen type like myself i enjoyed the movie very much especially the ending

1046,1046," the film that announced jordan peele as a fantastic story teller this is not your typical horror movie its briskly paced eerie and deliciously mindbending it is one of those films that is truly special it pays homage to the horror movies that came before it and combines that with excellent use of dark humour abstract uneasiness and an excellently written plot it falls more on the side of thriller rather than horror but it is truly an instant classic

now this movie wont be for everyone but im willing to bet those who gave it a low score simply did it because of how white people are portrayed in this movie

the one thing i did think about throughout this movie and definitely when chris got the big reveal about his girlfriend is from a movie i love sex with a white woman a black mans kryptonite  undercover brother

1063,1063, the film get out is a satirical horror film the movie is based on an interracial couple chris and rose and their visit to roses family in the movie every character has a large roll from the house maid georgina to chris best friend rod williams from the beginning you can see that the film is heavily influenced by its director jordan peele and his great humor mr peele uses a social issue in the movie and plays it out until its almost satirical to the audience one of the reasons i enjoyed it so much is for how relateable it can be for anyone no matter race or gender both sides can relate i really didnt like that get out tried to be like other horror films and have shock scares it was a failure in my opinion on the other hand the cinematography was great in this movie well shot and really made the movie scary they didnt spend a lot of money on the gore aspect of this film but you can tell they spent time on the special effects part of the movie in certain scenes get out pays homage to films such as psycho and the texas chain saw massacre i would recommend watching get out its a great movie for people that love horror as well as people that dont really enjoy it i enjoyed every second of it made me have so many emotions in one movie,positive,7

1071,1071," get out is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an immensely talented cast it breaks the boundaries of what we as an audience have come to expect from a film under the genre of thriller raising some sensitive subjects of race and stirring a debate that can be discussed once the film is over while keeping us in suspense and at the edge of our seats director jordan peele deserves to be applauded for this complicated task managing to put two things that do not seem like they should go together and making it work

the movie did have pacing issues there were moments throughout where i felt a little jaded from how slow it was all moving particularly being forty minutes and nothing immensely intense having had happened it could have moved a little faster which would have kept me more permanently invested

the cast is all around terrific but the biggest praise deservedly goes to daniel kaluuya he embodies the emotion frustration fear and confusion of this character with great subtlety and depth managing to find a great balance between the over the top moments and the more grounded scenes he deserves all the awards praise he gets for his performance

immensely thrilling and different a refreshing take on the horror genre i would certainly recommend get out to anyone looking for a good one

a young africanamerican is bewildered when he goes to visit his girlfriends parents for the weekend getting a lot more than he bargained for

best performance: daniel kaluuya",positive,7

1074,1074," the plot of this movie is race based and that is known from the story line itself the boy meets the girl whose family seems to welcome him very very easily a lot of the obama and tiger woods comments are thrown in deliberately to make him seem comfortable

comfort deludes him there was something amiss

there were a few strange events going on that made him curious and then frightened it is revealed slowly near the very end this plot is difficult to predict despite several hints thrown in

overall the plot made it worthwhile but the acting of the lead actor was soso in my opinion despite rave reviews i felt the girls acting was better given the character she was portraying

1076,1076," the last horror movie i truly enjoyed was probably cabin in the woods recently i liked green room and split but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea jordan peeles get out felt like the universe had heard my prayers a smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor and yet a still bone chilling plot how have we been so blessed the balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again all of the performances were pitch perfect alison williams with the keys and i anticipate this is only the beginning of daniel kaluuyas rise i often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horrorthriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as a scary movie you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends having peeles name attached and released by universal on the perfect weekend only up against week  of lego batman gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is creepy as all hell and maybe a little too believable

the characters were very shallow to the point of which none of their reasoning nor actions were understandable only one character felt remotely likeable and natural

this is a mediocre experience it if wasnt for the social commentary it is not only incorporated into the story and the characters but literally makes up the entire movie evidently the focus was on the wrong things

1085,1085," the  film get out by jordan peele is a unique horrorthriller that uses satire to illustrate the injustices faced by the black community in america in  the film won an academy award for best screenplay and received nominations in both the best director jordan peele and best actor daniel kaluuya categories get out was produced in order to defy the statistic that the black character is typically the first to be killed in horror movies

get out follows a black photographer chris washington daniel kaluuya and his white girlfriend rose armitage allison williams as they take a trip from the city up to roses familys rural and luxurious property for the weekendreaching the meet the parents milestone of their relationship after roses parents missy catherine keener a hypnotherapist and dean bradley whitford a neurosurgeon meet chris the weekend slowly goes sideways roses parents are overly accommodating of chris and their daughters interracial relationship which culminates to a series of unforeseen and increasingly disturbing events

the award winning screenplay of this film was excellent in foreshadowing the future actions of the antagonists missy and deans behaviour lead viewers to believe there is an ulterior reason for chris presence the storyline of get out encapsulates white privilege tbe setting of the grand estate embellishes the theme of the purity and superiority of the white race through a white supremacists eyes

the soundtrack that accompanied the hypnotic storyline of the film featured billboard artist childish gambino and one of his most popular songs redbone jordan peele discusses why he chose to feature the song in his film: i wanted to make sure that this movie satisfied the black horror movie audiences need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent observant people would do

the special effects in get out accompany the uneasiness of the film phenomenally the effects exhibit many hitchcockian elements elements that are commonly seen in films of alfred hitchcocks that are almost more unsettling than the storyline in itself

even if you arent a fan of horror i recommend watching this film the cinematography and screenplay alone are so captivating that the disturbing scenes are worth watching",positive,8

1097,1097," get out gets half a good film unfortunately though ive seen both halves and therefore half points is all that i can score here

without a doubt there is a lot to admire and i liked several aspects of the film in particular the audience mystery was held up in parallel with our protagonists: even though i knew that i was watching a horror film my own inability to orientate to the nature and form of the threat was nicely delayed through the opening scenes i had not read reviews or any contaminating information beforehand so my responses to the films stimulus were well piqued by the film

also i liked how the double issue of an interracial couple and a mixed social class couple acted to utterly inoculate our protagonist from his normal human ability to sense when things are off or potentially harmful

after all that nice establishment of our characters their environment and story start points i found that nothing positive lasted for long for me

people got stupider and events got more ridiculous until only lashings of coincidences and plot armour were being presented

oddly unbalanced comedy entered at about this stage too

by the final act i was bored and unengaged: nothing new was being adventured any longer and plot devices were blatant

the explosion of suspense to scares was a whimper after a very long slow build up

i dont follow why the film needed to jettison its attachment to character building in order to provide so little shock and awe

i rate a  for a film that tentatively interested me with its mature attention to character and legitimate scenario making but then completely lost me as it let its jack in the box off for the second half",positive,10
1099,1099, being different always have two ways to go either it will be easily accepted in the audience or thrashed severely by the same people it took the risk and fortunately it worked out jordan peele has done an impressive job with the screenplay and presentation of the story the clever use of passive racism and well written dialogues did their work  they made the story engaging in the buildup phase the sound score and the edits were brilliantly done all of the technical aspects created an eeriness that gradually keeps you on the edge the whole time performances as usual were magnificent especially from the lead actor daniel kaluuya the brutality and the gore in the climax fulfilled the story it makes your heart racing now you must be wondering if im praising this film that much  then why im giving this a  there are some reasons for that the rod williams character annoyed me the most i dont understand the need of adding unnecessary comic scenes or humours into these kind of movies which are supposed to be serious and scary throughout  well im not going to spoil the main concept but it felt poorly explained and illogical in a sense the story could have easily elaborated all the facts in much more clearer fashion the director wanted to put all of our attention to the main character of chris  and in order to achieve that he somehow neglected the other major character buildups those were needed in my opinion overall a technically sound movie that delivers on the main subject of racism culture and at the same time makes you uneasy and scared but in no way its a flawless film,positive,8

1106,1106," right off the bat i knew get out was going to be something unique sporting a trailer that resembled something so perfectly on the fence between funny and eerie this is a movie that has oceans of hype and deserves every drop of it youll never get a film like this again

plot a black man retreats with his white girlfriend to her family home out on the countryside meeting her family for the first time with insecurity of his ethnicity he notices that the white folks out there seem to have heightened ideals of black people in terms of physicality culture and behavior the genius of the film is that it takes something so very real pokes and prods at stereotypes while also making you laugh at it i cannot give away much of the plot without spoiling it but i will say this the plot twist will rock you never has a resolution been so culturally relevant yet also fictionally disturbing

writing perfect writing the conversations seem natural yet winkingly objective when foreshadowing humor hits you in all the right places never having an offbeat moment the whole story and idea behind it is ingenius id really like to sit down with jordan peele and investigate him for this one theres very much a reality behind the script and i think that reality not only applies to common society but primarily high society

charactersacting dude i have nothing but praise so just leave now if you cant believe me the acting is spot on you can feel the awkwardness sense when somebody may not be as they present themselves and the characters are all pitch perfect for their roles sure there is that horror movie tone to it but nothing campy or derived alot of moments here where the acting really makes the script pop and sizzle creating unforgettable scenes

quality the camera angles and filming are spot on never having a predictable angle the opening scene is so simple yet executed with grace drawing you in immediately the sound is booming when needed the violence is pretty nasty but not frequent the scares come in such a simple form that plays off of your knowledge more than using loud noise and mosterous imagery to shake you

get out is a classic i applauded my tv screen my first time watching it if you want something that will creep you out intrigue you while also making you laugh sit down and get cozy the theme of the film is probably the greatest thing about it",positive,7

1116,1116," so it feels silly reviewing a movie that everyone has either seen or reviewed but i do these for me so here goes

tldr  very interesting movie really makes you think and gets you hooked right in lots of feelings of anxiety and confusion very well shot and put together feels like an episode of the twilight zone with a rather abrupt but solid ending

ive held off watching get out for while now so i figured i should probably get to it the movie is often listed as a thrillerhorrorcomedy which seems like the odd mix of genres but the blend works well the comedy isnt overly there ruining the suspense or terror its very well included in the form of  character from time to time

the tension created right off the bat and the awkward feeling of something is not right here is great and makes you very interested in what is happeninggoing to happen about  minutes into the movie you start to think am i watching a modern episode of the twilight zone how fitting with jordan peele being the new host of the show at first you might feel like the movie is predictable or that you know whats going to happen and in some ways you may be right but there are still some interesting story points that you might not expect overall it was very enjoyable very captivating and a pretty fabtastic movie in the end",positive,6

the movie also made excellent use of its score and sound to heightened the tension in the film a great suspense thriller overall  out of

1122,1122," perfect

get out is a phemonemal debut for jordan peele who surprised the whole movie industry with this movie a combination of his directing and writing skills made a huge impact in this masterpiece the main plus side besides amazing plot is the way how he managed to create a creepy atmosphere with the help of intensive terrifying music and nice cinematography another plus was the way he handled the question of racism very superbly as he shown that its still a sensitive topic to this date for example showing that modern day slavery the black market or illegal surgeries and many more problem are still present in the world

the cast for this movie was another huge aspect in a success of this film as there was a lot of chemistry between all of the actors and actresses daniel kaluuya as chris and allison williams as rose fulfilled their job as the leading characters but astonishingly the biggest surprise came from lil rel howery as walter who has relieved me from the tension with his hillariously funny scenes throughout the whole  hour and  minutes catherine keener bradley whitford and caleb landry jones played the role of a roses allison williams creepy family very good as the discomfort escalates to the final act

after all i feel like everything just graduates though the whole movie from best to topnotch material watching it multiple times and each time finding the one of many peeles easter eggs i couldnt find or come up with any flaws get out will play with your mind and make you wonder how why and what is happening at last get out has became one of my favourites and i cant give it any other mark than  out of  hope you will find my review helpful",positive,9

1126,1126, get out was a movie that was being talked about after the movie that covers topics that are still relevent in the us even today which is that african americans are still being abused and its becoming more and more regular in america in the last couple of years the story follows chris a black man who is going to visit his white girlfriend roses parents and what seems like a normal trip slowly turns into a strange turns of events as the parents dark intentions are found out the cast is the amazing daniel kaluuya as chris washington as well as allison williamscatherine keener bradley whitfordcaleb landry jonesmarcus hendersonbetty gabriellakeith stanfieldstephen root and lil rel howery its such a well blended cast they blend all sorts of talent and the cast bring out all of the chilling elements of the movie get out is a landmark movie and we have to thank jordan peele fpr a movie that is terrifing and culturaly important as it has become and you have to thank him for showing us what it is like for a african american who gets targeted and the storys elements of horror and social commentary on the usa and african americans in their day to day struggles and that is why i love this movie,negative,2
1127,1127," fundamentally this is not an interesting film its not particularly well written does not have any particularly outstanding performances the plot is pedestrian and the whole gamut of available cliches is run through

yet get out demanded that i watch it principally because its writer and director won the academy award for best screenplay which on reflection says more about the current state of the academy than it does about the film itself

as genuine fan of jordan peeles key and peele i was excited to see this film especially after the universal praise the film received from critics before its writer was garlanded with an oscar perhaps too much of a fan i could not escape the sensation of hearing jordan peele deliver the lines he had written for his characters instead of the characters appearing as entities whole and believable

the film was certainly successful but sadly it will not age well i suspect

hey im not saying it was bad all things considered it was a perfectly serviceable scifihorror thriller i just dont see it being anything particularly special i think an awful lot of the accolades its getting about exposing racial issues have far more to do with viewers projections and wishful thinking than anything inherent in the film

1133,1133," get out starts strongly with several chilling moments but doesnt quite come together in the end

for most of its runtime it is a rebuttal to anyone who thinks that the horror genre cannot be socially relevant from its opening scenes reminding us of trayvon martin to the protagonist meeting affluent types at a party none of whom can avoid mentioning his ethnicity aspects of get out feel almost too timely and onpoint perhaps uncomfortably so which is of course a great place to set a horror movie

the movie shows its hand pretty early which is not necessarily a bad thing the problem is that it has you primed for a big reveal and i found myself a bit let down by the climax and its conclusion the beginning was handled so skilfully i was obviously hoping it would continue in kind however it went too far into standard horror territory in the end and seemed to lose touch with the social conscience that had made its first act so interesting",positive,8

status: approved

a young african american man visits his european american girlfriends family estate where he learns that many of its residents who are black have gone missing and he soon learns the horrible truth when another frantic africanamerican warns him to get out he soon learns this is easier said than done

what i liked:

¬ïgreat cast

¬ïwriting and directing was on point

¬ïslow buildup with a satisfying pay off

¬ïgood job making the audience feel uncomfortable

¬ïmoments of comedy really do work

¬ïfun mix of horror and social commentary all that really work for the films advantages

¬ïthe music was good

¬ïmovie does a good job creating characters we can root for and characters we hate

what i didnt like:

¬ïsome out of place scenes

¬ïwhile the music was good there were places where they put in music where it was unnecessary not only was the music in those moments unnecessary but it was also pretty overbearing

consensus:

a nearhorror masterpiece i feel like this movie will end up being a classic in years to come its acting the writing and the horror social commentary all work proving that jordan peele has more to offer than comedy and can create scenes with tension he also proves that maybe behind the camera works best for him showing how creative he can really be i recommend seeing this in theaters just to show hollywood that original movies are welcome and also that original movies can be very very good",negative,1
1150,1150," get out is a fantastic original and unique horror movie that is a must see which contains great acting and everything else you dream of in a top notch horror film

basic plot of the movie is that our main character named chris is in an interracial relationship and the lady that is his love is takin him home to see the folks and it turns out to be quite an interesting and terrifying adventure he had not anticipated

jordan peele does a fantastic job with his directorial debut with this instant classic that no one saw coming from the initial scene all the way up to the beginning of the third act i was enticed by all that was on the screen and screaming why the tension is built up so phenomenally throughout the whole movie in all the right ways as opposed to all the crappy clich√©s that are just been shoved down our throats now a days every scare is real and builds the momentum of the movie and finally when all comes together it definitely hits in the right spots very nice twists within the story as well that are definitely original and blew my mind

the racial satire of the movie was also not extremely uncomfortable watching the trailers i expected stereotypical conversations where white people awkwardly try and relate to black people though it does contain this in the movie it is not so terrible where you cant look at the screen it evens out pretty well and many comments may just make you laugh out loud spit out your soda or drop that popcorn of yours

acting is superb and especially by kaluuya with most of his best scenes being when he wasnt even speaking all other roles were also very well done but main spotlight definitely goes to kaluuya

the comedy in this movie was just straight up awesome kaluuyas go to guy in the movie is a powerhouse of laughs that will leave you in stitches for  of the time he is on screen absolutely hilarious

i only wish that the movie didnt end so abruptly that would be my only complaint maybe add some more struggle would be my opinion

get out is a fantastic directorial debut for peele in the horror genre with fantastic acting an enticing riveting story that hooks you and makes need to know more and why it hits with good twists and will also have you dying in stitches just like the key and peele sketches

a must see go see it",positive,9

1155,1155," this movie seem to have a lot of critics and others praising it so having a boring weekend i decided to check it out and i soon learned that this movie is not suspenseful it is not thrilling and is about as scary as watching my towl dry up in the sun

so we have a black man as the lead actor and the movie it sort of touched on some of the problems that apparently excist with interracial dating the girl who is white and her family which is white and their friends also white mumbles a lot of things about being white and voting for obama like that is a good thing and how tiger woods is a great golfer yawn about here i was actually starting to think of golf how to build a great golf course how watching paint dry on said golf course

i saw a critic stating this movie is groundbreaking  yea true it is groundbreaking for insomniacs the first half of this movie and they will fall down sleeping for sure

so before i head into the second half of this movie which is sort of fun but not in a good way let me list a few good things about it this movie is pretty well acted the setting is nice and fitting a few scenes are really well done some humor lands pretty well and although the mystery of the story is easy to figure out after min i was still a bit intrigued how they would pull it off this movie is not horrible all the time the first half although kind of weird in tone and boring is pretty okay and the movie keep itself decently in its own world and as such its pretty well made

with that said this movie is so boring so so boring not only because that mystery of the movie is so transparent but also because this movie do not know what it want to be is it a thriller scary movie social commentary love story is it supposed to be funny it feel all over the place on imdb it states horror mystery thriller uhm okay sure it is not so common that a black guy do not die first in a horror movie and that although he is sort of the token black guy he is still the main driving point of the movie pretty much everything depends on what he does but that also feels out of place not because he is black but because he is made so out of place and written almost as the comedic relief rather then the main actor

in the second half of this movie we see it rolling out all of that boring stuff we already figured out and it is actually very funny not intentionally funny but when you have a black guy almost written like the comedic relief being the lead in a supposed thriller with a plot we already figured out with tons of weirdo white people around it get hilariously funny the last min especially i was laughing out loud at how stupid everything is in this movie

i actually do think there is a good movie in here somewhere and i can see the intent as positive but the execution and the writing especially the writing in the second half of the movie is so poorly done how anyone can praise this movie is beyond me but apparently a black lead and a black director is all that is needed to get celebrated this is really badly put together movie and although it have some good traits and i think this could have been good it is one of the worst movies i have seen the only redeeming trait of this movie is that it is unintentionally funny this is the sort of movie you can do drinking games to but is that the sort of movie you want to get praise for

i cannot recommend this to anyone but if you watch this get a lot of beers and everytime someone does something which is unintentionally funny drink",positive,8

i spent the first  minutes thinking it would be sjw movie and seriously thinking about turning it off the ending kind of made up to it but a movie that fails at pace and genre shouldnt have an  rating

1187,1187," its not amazing its a well done little thriller but its nothing to go crazy over i thought the set up and feel were well done but then the end kinda fell apart

they had this cool idea and approach and then the end just becomes your typical thriller ending i felt like they didnt deliver on the promise that had been made with the first half i dont know if they got lazy at the end and gave into convention or what but i was disappointed with the sudden lack of quality

and allison williams did not look believable holding a gun she might be one of the best looking women alive right now but she obviously had no idea how to hold a gun the damn thing probably weighed more than she did

1189,1189, interesting premise but its too skeletal the hype was so massive that halfway thru i realized this wasnt nearly as impressive or layered as i was led to believe which was a shame people who have nothing to say say it loudly peele had an idea to impart too bad he didnt bother to develop the characters enough for me to treat the message seriously i guess the motivation for everything is    racism the older couple fell in love over their shared love of   racism the thot daughter spends her life trapping african american guys because shes eager to be  racist and how presumptive to think every obese white girl wants to bid on her own black man to imprison the heart buys what the heart buys offensive i did get chills from the housekeeper though that actress betty gabriel did this thing where she wept in silent misery as she delivered affirmative lines and it was awesome to see that contradictory performance but   i still dont know where the running man got to catherine keeners character was a paper doll sprung to life just yesterday but she had fun with it the pseudo science of the ancestor was a crutch and the sunken place is a variation on a device weve seen used several times in several films cartoons have more backstory besides that its shockingly racist which i guess is ok as long as its racism against white people amirite  star movie  stars for betty gabriel,positive,5
1190,1190, i liked this movie for presenting us in funny scary and ironic way the discrimination racial and exploitation of people it has many funny and weird small events in form of odd behaviors which are the best part of the movie there is also the presence of variety of people location police which makes this movie not that boring and empty like some worse others i also liked the presence of typical modern stuff like girlfriend friends smartphone laptop cars jokes and variety of unique characters all of which we can associate with real life counterparts of todays modern age also i liked that movie is very detailed and graphic the talk is clear minimum and details are easily notced for example the manners devices software nature characteristics of characters ending is also although not perfectly solved still interesting and filled with excitement and other feelings from when i first watched this movie in  and then again in  it did not leave any different impression than the first time not perfect but definitely a higher quality movie much better than most todays movies which are somehow unclear blurry and not understandible this is one of those movies that give everybody the creeps most characters looks so real and genuine for example the woman psychiatrist looks like typical psychiatrist hypnotiser mom rich womanguests look like guestsfriends like friends they all act unique immersed and give the impression and association of being real,positive,9
1191,1191," while deciding on which movie to watch i started thinking about movies that it seemed that everyone loved and after some thinking i came up jordan peeles get out having had high expectations for this movie i can honestly and happily say that it didnt disappoint one bit it was every bit of what critics and casuals had said about it and more

this mixture of a horror suspense and thriller movie follows a young couple named chris daniel kaluuya and his girlfriend rose allison williams chris an african american man was going to meet roses all white family including her neurosurgeon dad dean bradley whitford and her hypnotherapist mom missy catherine keener after the over comforting welcome by dean and missy chris notices the two african american workers at the house and their strange behavior after a chilling unplanned and forced hypnotherapy session at night with missy chris is beginning to get even more freaked out but hey at least it helped him quit smoking the next day after meeting and talking with roses extended family he notices that all they talk about are his genetic traits and cant shake the feeling that something is wrong this mix of positive and negative discrimination and stereotypes right to his face leaves him speechless and worried with rose seemingly being the only one that genuinely supports him

jordan peele excellently builds up the tension of the movie through what chris sees and experiences and builds as much suspense as possible before revealing the truth similarly to karyn kusamas the invitation both films build as much tension and suspense as possible through the suspicious and so called weird actions of the characters until you cant wait anymore for the big reveal this masterclass of a thriller movie combined with a little bit of horror was fantastic for keeping fans and me hooked to the movie not wanting to miss any of it

the acting was a huge part of this movies success daniel kaluuya brilliantly portrays what we would all be feeling in his situation and makes the movie seem extremely realistic his acting clearly shows how he gets more and more worried as the weekend progresses allison williams also shows off her acting ability as she throughout the movie showcased how genuine and supportive she is of chris the sound throughout the movie also cleverly showcased the building of the tension and suspense of the movie building the mood and helping progress the movies plot along brilliantly

peele also combines both the awesomeness of a fantastic thriller and horror movie with talking about prominent racial issues rose and her family at first seem absolutely supportive of chris and his race with dean saying that he would have voted for obama for a third term if he could however throughout the weekend the all white family only comments about chriss race and his genetic traits this underlying racism that some people say and use is usually hard to portray clearly but peele has portrayed it marvelously peele has included some stereotypes of both african american and white people which may or may not be true and anger some people however his main message about talking about and showing underlying racism from people who were presumed as not racist was clearly shown and peele remarkably combined that powerful message with a stunning movie

jordan peeles get out deserves all of the praise that has been said about it it skillfully talks about a prominent social issue while still providing entertainment to its viewers believe me while watching this movie you wont want to get out of your seat for anything",positive,9

1194,1194," when i watched get out i had no idea of the stepford wives  existence so my first thoughts were clever intelligent alternate representation of racism authentic prototypical unique one day i wanted to watch a high quality classic film preferably horror and this is how i found the stepford wives  after watching this film i started to realise that had many similarities with get out according to the producer of this film the stepford wives was a big influence for the making of this film

so my review had to be changed one of the main ideas the brainwashing was the same but for the different reasons i appreciated the fact that they used this specific social problem as the main topic of the film racism in combination with science biology hypnosis etc

lets get in the plot i really liked the fact that we had a really clever protagonist from the beginning of this film unfortunately it lacks in many films i liked how the mystery was unfolding creepy is the suitable word

very good performances especially doctor and the servants one the directing was also very good but the most important thing was the fact that there are many memorable scenes from this film that are hard to forget i dont want to forget

the gore is mediocre but is visible mostly at the end of the film it also contains much agony which i love and of course it contains some comedic scenes by the protagonists friend i really enjoyed watching this film

in conclusion is this film authentic yes and no is there parthenogenesis in art not at all was this film creative way more creative than you think since it blended many topics into one it still gives me chills

highly recommended",positive,9
1195,1195," jordan peeles directorial debut is certainly impressive who would know that a man mostly regraded for comedy can make an intriguing horror drama i really like this film but what i mean by the title is that the st and nd act are great but the rd act is what lets it down

the third act isnt bad but its not as good as the previous  peele does such a good job at building up tension in this seemingly normal place that you kind of want it to pay off well this is probably personal i think that a film like this shouldnt have ended in a blood bath but again thats just me

of course im joking i dont know a lot about racism but is unnecessary to watch this movie is a really entertaining movie even if you dont get the social commentary in the story

the acting is on point the twist are unexpected and the last  minutes are worthy of all your money so go ahead and give it a try its a decent movie

1208,1208," i watched this film during my horror film course this semester prior to the last session i had no idea what the film was about or even that it was so new

jordan peele takes viewers on an emotional journey in this film just as the viewer gets comfortable with the direction of the plot he throws several twist and turns into the mix to keep things fun and exciting i would have thought that jordan peele writing a horror film would be lead in a more comedic direction with a few small elements of scary he does the exact opposite this film left me guessing and on the edge of my seat

get out gives the viewer more of a mental scare as peele stays away from the typical cheap jump scares you might be expecting i could watch this film again and again while still finding a different element to ponder and evaluate

the actors in the film are just amazing how they can hold their cool in such obscure situations is baffling the film deserves awards that it did not have the chance to win being able to combine horror and comedy in a wellbalanced film deserves much more recognition i would truly like to see another horror film from jordan peele as i feel he has found a way to create a new more modern horror film

1221,1221," first time director jordan peele as in the one of lead stars from the comedy tv series key  peele brings us a new fresh and very unexpected film for cinema lovers get out is aimed at the genre of horror and thriller with a little touch of good humor get out tells the story of a young africanamerican male chris who agrees to finally visit his caucasian girlfriends family at their home estate

upon arrival everything appears to be what you would expect when meeting a girlfriends parents however within a matter of timestrange things start occurring around the family home chris begins to become concerned and curious and in order not to spoil the films plot this is all im going to say

while watching get out i discovered that i was having a really great time with so many sequels and reboots this year get out felt like i was breathing in clean fresh air the genre of horrorthriller must be very challenging by todays standards to come up with fresh and creative ideas considering as i said above this is jordan peeles st official film with him directing the end results are very good

get out does a fantastic job at keeping the film suspenseful and the viewer hooked until the end credits at no point did i check my watch because i was bored i was completely pulled into the films plot and i wasnt leaving the cinemas until i got answers and explanations for all the strange things chris was discovering around him

the film also has an outstanding audio track the clever use of eerie music throughout will suddenly switch to a well known classic song letting the audience know that its ok to have fun with this movie jordan peeles camera work is also something to be praised the clever use of multiple angles and slow panning is something that i would call hitchcock style many times throughout the film i was watching something that shocked me or had me in suspense but no matter what i couldnt help it but to have a smile on my face too when i see s scary movie i am a man who doesnt normally jump out of his seat but this movie got me to jump twice once even yelling at the cinema screen

get out is a film that finesse movie reviews suggest you shouldnt miss in  i feel its a film that will really surprise and i recommend this for those who enjoy an interesting story with suspenseful moments the film does have a couple of faults to be sure but they are so minor i refuse to talk about them online i found the film to be unpredictable but even when i knew something was coming i was so keen to see it happen as this film had me very invested in it

1270,1270," i heard much good about this movie so i had high hopes from the very first line of the movie get out beats you over the head with its themes of racism there was no tact or subtlety of emotional persuation the film simply tells you how to feel which was at times confusing for example when the couple first meets the parents the parents seem friendly but simply the young couples uncomfortable reactions to the parents tells you to feel awkward because this is an awkward encounter even though the parents did nothing yet to elicit this kind of uncomfortable behavior it really shows a weakness in writing when the theme of the movie is its only real content the main character was hopelessly uninteresting and although the cast showed some potential talent the eyerolling moments throughout their interactions took away from any real substance this is what happens when the message of the movie takes precedence over actual good film making there were moments that felt like what would have made a great comedy sketch about racism which makes sense give jordan peeles comedic background but instead these ridiculous and absurd moments were actually taken seriously i honestly had to start doing the second skipahead on my laptop because i couldnt bear a lot of this movie

oh and then there is the girlfriends sudden physical transformation when we realize as if its not already obvious that shes in on the slavery ploy hhmm perhaps making her look like a distopian lab woman rather than the normal girl she was the whole time should make us less sympathetic towards her when she dies youd think the fact that shes pretending to love men to lure them into slavery would be enough allinall this movie was not worth the  amazon price i paid for it and was a sad waste of my time",negative,4

1274,1274," the synopsis of get out doesnt give a clue as to what the film is really about i was expecting a modern deep film on interracial couples there have been a few films made about this topic already and were in the st century already i was pleasantly surprised get out gives you a great thriller experience with a unique twist the traditional kind of racism or ignorance you expect is not what you think people are somewhat fascinated and want superior physical bodies

these kind of cult or secretive groups in film are very interesting this is a great new spin on it i enjoyed it from start to end and was on the edge of my seat definitely worth a watch

maybe not being american is part of it then again if this was a good horror film that shouldnt be that important social commentary can be in a horror movie but in this case the lack of subtlety kept taking me out of the experience being boring is the cardinal sin of horror movies for that alone i do not recommend the ominous parts before the plot takes off and some good performances is the only reason i give it

1295,1295, a reimagination of the african american experience through the guise of a horror story following all the traditions associated with the genre that places arguably for the first time in the history of popular film the victim and dupe of the monsters as being distinguished by their marginalised status through race the film takes no shame in its identification with tradition given that it needs the audience to have some sense of familiarity in order for its messages to get across for example we know just by seeing the daunting panningout scene of roses parents house isolated in the middle of the forest what implications are held in store for chris in regards to the various levels of sanity he will encounter the role he will play in relation to the people he will encounter and the foreboding moral decline that awaits him because we have read edgar allan poe what we dont know however is specifically what struggles await him and what he will need to do to overcome them it is through this anticipation one which we have nurtured over the course of all the horror movies we have hitherto watched that we become most surprised given that what we expect as being unfamiliar is inevitably familiar to an overwhelmingly uncomfortable degree this is because as fantastical as the films premise is it alludes to a repression that pervaded a large part of american history which we are ultimately forced to recognise within ourselves the final scene of the film is so effective for this reason and consequently draws us to think quite deeply about what it is that causes us to react the way we do,positive,7

1297,1297, director jordan peele leaves audiences and critics around the world speechless and mesmerized with his incredibly successful and powerful debut film get out the immaculate horrorthriller comedy is successful in giving viewers a truly unique and horrific experience that goes far beyond typical horror cliches by delving into themes of modern day racism the plot focuses around a young and ubran biracial couple of chris washington daniel kaluuya an african american man and rose armitage allison williams a white woman in the film the couple ventures off on a weekend excursion to visit her parents dean bradley whitford and missy catherine keener armitage who have never met chris and who are also completely unaware of chriss ethnic background chris questions whether roses parents will approve of him because of his color but rose assures him that his parents are blind to race when they arrive chris quickly picks up on roses parents attempts to accommodate chriss racial background such as stating that if they could they would vote for obama for a third term however as the weekend advances chris find himself in some rather disturbing and frightening experiences that makes him question rose and her familys values and beliefs when he finally becomes aware of the familys true and deviant intents chris decides that in order to survive he needs to get out audiences and critics alike were absolutely shocked to learn that the infamously comedic actor jordan peele who has started in television shows and movies such as key  peele and keanu would be making his directorial debut with a horror movie a genre which is generally not favored by the film industry because of his minimal background with the genre many doubted that the film would be of any substance and most assumed that it would be a box office flop to everyones surprise however viewers found that the film was loaded with skincrawling scenes dark humor and numerous cryptic messages that relate to society as a whole jordan peeles unique directing style accompanied by strong cast performances as well as the films ability to dive into controversial topics greatly strengthens the films reputation as one of the best horror films ever made one of peeles greatest attributes as a director is his ability to convey strong and important messages within his films through an abundance of small yet important details that strengthen the viewers understanding of the plot and theme which in the case of get out is modern day racism peeles ability to blend and hide important themes and plot points within small details puts directors such as kubrick to shame popular scenes such as the black car scene the cereal scene the deer scene the shotgun scene and the running scene all help to bring the plot together as well as strengthen the films recurring theme of racism in the twenty first century peele was even able to utilize the critically acclaimed song redbone by rapper childish gambino to help foreshadow the events of the film another one of peeles greatest attributes as a director is his ability to create a truly unique and original film that steers away from the overused cliches that are so prevalent in modern horror films instead of creating a film that was loaded with cliches such as excessive gore falling female protagonists and stupid teenagers peele focuses on showcasing the true and complex terrors of modern day racism such as police brutality injustice in the court system the erasure of black culture and the systematic oppression of african americans in america although the plot is a little far fetched many still find that they are able relate to what chris feels and goes through over the duration of the film the spectacular performances within this film also contribute to get outs reputation as one of the greatest horror films ever made daniel kaluuyas incredible performance gives audiences a believable look into the reality of african american males in modern day america as well as showcases the recurring oppression that many african americans face throughout the film audiences feel chriss genuine sense of caution when visiting roses all white family his performance further communicates how african americans feel in the presence of police officers and in situations when african americans are made to feel uncomfortable bradley whitford and catherine keener also believably portray the way in which many modern whites view and treat african americans they overemphasize the fact that chris is black in a failed attempt to make him feel more comfortable rather than focusing on him as a person they also utilize stereotypes to generalize the african american race and culture through scenes like the obama scene and the running scene these performances give the film a realistic sense by accurately characterizing the hidden racism that is all to prevalent in the country today get out is one hell of a film that will surely keep viewers on the edge of their seats and the terror that the audience experiences will surely stay with them far past the end credits with its sense of dread terror comedy and underlying societal themes get out very well may be one of the greatest horror films ever made,positive,5

jordan peele idea for get out is very unique and the armitage family was perfect for the story the was alot of symbolism in the movie which shows peeles talent in film making soundtrack fits perfectly throughout the whole film

1319,1319," american society has undergone certain traumas racial discrimination being one of them us racial discrimination has a long history in society and along with its articulation in the law politics education and the arts the movie get out engages and represents the common racial innuendoes which can be experienced in us society even nowadays the get out looks like a science fictiondrama in the cerebral sorting of people several similar points like a mass brainwashing and ethnic bias make this movie closer to the public masses that were indoctrinated to hatred in using similar methods holocaust movies  or the human centipede or closed society conspiracy movies

in the movie get out the closed society of medical professionals develops the racial theory in which they exercise white supremacy over black people african americans are subject to medical experiments sexual slavery and domestic duties the movie underlines the typical stereotype of african americans unable or incapable of mental or intellectual enterprises and shows how racial microaggression can be multifaceted for example when dean armitage the caucasian head of this closed club meets with chris the african american boyfriend of deans daughter he father denies his own racism by avowing that he supported obama as the first african american president it is a typical hook for people who try to refute the racist accusations by declaring that voting for obama gives immunization from racial discrimination allegations

another example of emphasizing the racial stereotypes in the movie is how the guests of the symposium in fact  auction looked at chris they looked at him as an object like goods for sale not as a person guests paid attention only to chriss physical appearance not to his personality his talents as a photographer and etc

in the ending of movie the brain of african americans are just simply removed and trashed in a bin metaphorically the scene of throwing georginas scalp in the thrash can symbolizes dean armitages racism theory they are interested only in the bodies not in the brain soul the racist neuroscientists pay attention to the physical body not mental capabilities of the brain of african americans moreover the final scenes reveal that crazy brain scholars believe the use of the body of an african american can increase their own lifespan

thus the movie allows viewers to extract a number of racial innuendoes however all of them can be qualified as verbal and nonverbal verbal elements of the movie constitute the bias of white characters against the black people which can be detected directly as racism of the main characters nonverbal scenes open the metaphorical level of the expression of racial attitudes of people who exercise their racial prejudice and bias the movie does not give solutions but it switches the american problems into the horror genre and focuses viewers to rethink the problem in the thriller framework",positive,7

and then the third act is quite a jump from the rest of the movie the resolution felt totally fake out of that world and not true to the characters and context presented in the movie before

the themes are there the ideas are there the talent is there but the plot asks too much suspension of disbelief and i dont like over the top endings for smart movies its wanting to have the cake and eat it too

1325,1325," this reminded me of league of gentlemen which was a british black comedy series black as in very dark humour about an outsider visiting a village full of very strange locals tonally this didnt come across as horror as much as it did a black comedy

its a decent premise and that feeling of being the outsider in a group of people pretending to accept you is played well

where the comedy comes in is in the behaviour of the other ethnic minorities as they respond to chris its more demented than scary as is caleb landry jones brad pitt impersonation as well as the whole idea behind the story  kind of like a sinister being john malkovich also starring catherine keener which makes sense as upon further reading i have discovered this is the unofficial sequel to bjm

still the film has its moments and you find yourself really rooting for chris willing him to get the hell out of there

the film missed a trick by confronting the horrors of racism in an everyday way instead opting for almost cinema of the absurd with more than a few surreal danny boylian moments

violence as the black mans only method of resolution also seems dubious other than that it was an enjoyable popcorn movie not sure it was worthy of an oscar it wasnt that good",positive,8

what i do not understand how and why this film was marketed as a horror flick when you do that expectations are set to actually have some scares and such a psychological thriller perhaps definitely a thriller and great crime flick i believe if you market it correctly then expectations are different and then the problems i have with the film disappear because i dont look for things that arent there this was the same issue with m night shyamalans the village when you rewatch and dont have horror movie expectations it becomes a better flick i hope the same holds for this as it was well written and could hold up",positive,10

with that out of the way i really liked the script and i thought the concept was incredibly interesting its one of the most original horror films ive seen in a long while and the acting was incredible the editing was great too although i remember it defintly followed a specific over exaggerated but only in a good way style of acting which i applaud them for honestly the reason i didnt really think much of this movie honestly just comes down to preference

1356,1356," get out is a horror movie directed by jordan peele and stars daniel kaluuya allison williams bradley whitford catherine keener and caleb landry jones

after reading so much positive reviews about the movie i was really excited about the movie but was also wondering if the movie lives on the expectations and the movie didnt proved me wrong

the acting is great and screenplay is gripping although the movie start getting predictable as it progress but still will not disappoint you the best part of the movie is that the director hasnt done anything to create horror such as no use of eerie music no jump scares no use of the darkness in fact the major part of the movie is shot in ample light

background music is been used nicely to create the terrifying atmosphere i really liked the movie and was impressed and yes the climax this will really shock you an entertaining movie",positive,5
1357,1357," perfectly watchable little tale on the horrorthriller spectrum

could have easily been a fair bit better than it is with a script that is somehow very subtle in some areas and painfully on the nose in others missed some potentially excellent fridge horror moments

but i like the story its fresh well paced and has well developed characters the racial aspect seems more cosmetic than substantial to me not that that really takes away much

i feel the script deserved a more experienced director its not badly directed but there are several scenes and instances that just feel naively realized especially regarding the generic score that gives the audience a heads up about what theyre supposed to be wary of which kills a lot of the horror potential

but despite the many wrong notes the film is essentially made of superior stuff and if only we could maybe get a differently edited version this could be a masterpiece",positive,5

1360,1360," i avoided this brilliant movie for some time simply because people kept referring to it as a horror film and when i think horror films i think gouged out eyes and chopped off limbs and intestines on the floor so the first thing i want to say is this is really more of a suspense movie and theres very little gore

once i finally watched it i was blown away this is one of those times when a movie really is as good as people say the movie does a beautiful job of ohsoslowly ramping up the strangeness letting each event build on the other in order to build something wonderfully convincing the suspense always builds slowly but by the end the movie is soooooo intense that half an hour after watching it i still feel jittery as hell

the filmmaking is sparse and economical telling a lot with every little movement every shot every comment daniel kaluuya is pitch perfect in the lead offering the sort of deep nuanced performance more common in searing dramas than thrillers

the story is fascinating and beautifully constructed with surprises that never come out of left field

this is also a very political movie it brought to mind a movie from my youth the stepford wives which also used suspense to highlight societys dark side the early parts of the movie are almost a treatise on microaggressions explaining them to white folk like me better than any of the million articles you can read on the subject

1406,1406," get out certainly appears promising a critically acclaimed oscarwinner this  horrorcomedy was billed as being guess whos coming to dinner as directed by ira levin with a large helping of meet the parents to be seen in the films comedy an intriguing combination it follows chris washington a young black photographer who comes with his white girlfriend rose to meet her parents initially anxious he asks nervously whether they know hes black to which she responds that theyre very liberal: they would have voted for obama a third time if they could he arrives and immediately notices certain irregularities: the cringeinducing overfriendliness of the parents the robotic disconcertingly broad smiles of the black housekeeper and groundskeeper and most ominously of all the fact that one of the people working for the parents logan bears an uncanny resemblance to a missing man andre hayworth

up to this point get out is fairly successful: the plot is immersing the acting from kaluuya is spoton as ever he behaves exactly as one would expect someone in his situation to something which adds to the believability immensely and its also fairly enjoyable

however without giving anything away the film starts to collapse the more it progresses firstly the tension disappears as soon as the facts start to be revealed this is because as h p lovecraft said the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown as a horror get out would be much better if ambiguity about the familys intentions remained in place up to the films end that way the film would have been able to become more frightening as it progressed not less this is especially relevant as even at the start the film isnt particularly scary

secondly none of the characters are at all welldeveloped if youre going to try to make a social commentary about racial relations in supposedly postracial america it is essential that developed and complex characters exist that can say something about the zeitgeist kaluuya as ive said does do a good job but the script is so poor in this regard that not even he can make chris interesting perhaps jordan peele the director hoped to make him into an everyman figure but this just demonstrates a poor understanding of what an everyman is its not a person with no character but a person with a character everyone can relate to all the other characters similarly seem remarkably onedimensional rose has no character at all other than being emotionally detached and cruel sure the way allison williams the actress who plays her manipulates the audience into trusting her at the start is clever enough but she goes from being a character who is if a little boring at least believable to a caricature of evil that is undeveloped and onesided

thirdly the twists arent nearly as unexpected and unpredictable as peele seems to think i dont want to give any spoilers but anyone whos even vaguely acquainted with the book or film adaptation of the stepford wives will be able to guess the main twist from a mile off the hints should have been much more subtle for the desired effect to be achieved

fourth there are the blatant plot holes which are drawn into this film like moths to a flame to take one lets just say that chris would have to have extraordinary flexibility to manage his escape

finally the film makes some unoriginal points on race relations that will be evident to any viewer in the first five minutes and then it proceeds to hammer these home for the next oneandahalf hours it spends its time repeatedly emphasizing that the characters are white liberals not neonazi skinheads or southern rednecks if this point was just made once powerfully the film could work instead it repeatedly makes it with dull jokes as if peele intends for the quantity of his complaints to make up for their forgettable delivery slavery lack of attention paid to missing black americans and the myth of black people having advantages that white people dont are all extremely important subjects but peele rants about them so much in the film that his comments eventually lose all power

lots of people say that this film is racist i dont think this is a valid criticism the lack of good white characters is not saying that white people are bad whilst black people are good its saying that structures in america are such that

dont bother with it try charles burnett or steve mcqueen films instead two directors vastly more talented than peele will ever be",negative,3
1407,1407," chris daniel kaluuya is an africanamerican man who visits his white girlfriends allison williams parents for a weekend gateway upstate as soon as he arrives he starts to notice some weird things happening that he never expected

get out is for sure one of the best physiological horror films ever powerful story powerful message amazing directing and brilliantly written

daniel kaluuyas plays chris washington performance was so shocking the sunken place scene was one of my favorite scenes of all time a scene that will get stuck in your head all because of the amazing performance of daniel kaluuya his eyes and the way he was crying makes you feel that you are him for a bit and you are indeed stuck with him in the sunken place and you cant move from your seat all of the supporting cast was a great choice especially allison williams also lil rel howerys funny character rod williams who gave the film a great taste and some funny jokes that werent silly or boring like these cheap horror movies

the screenplay was so great and very well written its like everything was written for a reason and youll notice it later great job to jordan peele and so glad that he got an oscar for that

the set design was great chris apartment at the beginning of the film and the house of the armitage family everything was great that blue teacup was a thing that i will never forget and anytime ill see a blue teacup i will remember get out immediately it just gets stuck in your head really loved its design

the custom designs was a thing that i felt like it was missing im not talking about chris blue shirt custom cause it was great but it couldve been way better

cinematography  colors were also a thing that i felt like it was missing from the movie especially that the films story would really match with some colors and it wouldve given the movie or a certain scene a better taste but it wass that bad

finally the great music score that did match with the whole film and with every scene perfectly the music of the opening title scene was great and the song that was playing when chris was packing for the weekend at the beginning of the film was a great choice because if you listen to the lyrics it matches with the whole story of the film it says: stay woke and dont close your eyes also the music that was playing in the sunken place scene was so cool especially with how he was falling

a great physiological horror film but not the best one tho because in my opinion black swan  is the best physiological horror film ever but get out is still one of the best and highly recommend it

1434,1434," this movie manages to perfectly ride the line between having some great aspects and some really horrible ones at the same time the acting cinematography and music are immaculate throughout the movie but it cant resuscitate the plot and confusing theme

the tropes and cliches of the characters are so over the top during the first  that a theme of satire feels like its being presented but by the end under a barrage of underlying and overt social commentary it tries to demand you take them seriously in what feels like a campy predictable twist of events definitely not horror definitely not comical much more of a middle of the road thriller that is becomes easily forgettable with a glacially slow middle section nonsensensical beginning and a walkoffintothenight ending much of the dialogue was forgettable and almost felt comically forced at times the climax scenes considered horror werent anything special at all the only really great parts are the ones that obviously are a take on a black mirror episode

ultimately this movie comes across to me as a shell of an idea that they scripted and filled in voids with vapid social commentary and forced cliches i still think there could have been  different ways they could have made this into a great movie and i really wanted it to live up to the hype the heart of a great idea is there its just the execution and confusing plot beginning ending and tone that squanders it

what i keep noticing in movies coming out recently is a penchant for hitting you over the head with information and forcing how you should feel rather than building character theme and plot its really ineffective and lazy i guess i just prefer more subtle psychological horror like the shining or something like american history x where it doesnt forcibly spell out everything like we so much of in this twitter generation",positive,6
1435,1435," like the stepford wives but reframed with a new subjugated group if you want masterful suspense go and watch hitchcock or read ira levin do not watch this black paranoia flick with boring twist the characters are bland all the whities are portrayed as inexplicably evil the action is dull and crude in essence its been done before but much better

1437,1437," an offbeat horror film and satirical social commentary about race in america where the upper middle class liberals are the creepy villains and their political correctness is actually an overcompensation to mask the disturbing prejudices that lurk beneath the film takes a detour from the conventional formula of the paranoid communityconspiracy thriller but its ultimately just an update on the stepford wives with a racial twist

this is an assured debut from comedian jordan peele helped by an acutely ott hitchcockian score and some winning performances with particular noteworthy turns from bradley whitford who is perfectly cast as the overeager and sinister father and daniel kaluuya who balances that meet the parents awkward politeness with a jagged edge of paranoia there are many squirm in your seat moments  some of which are just the scenes where the thinlyveiled animosity and racial subtext bubble beneath the surface of the dialogue  and the unsettling atmosphere of the piece keeps you digesting in the dark underbelly of rich white suburbia right alongside kaluuyas protagonist

peele manages to keep the story taut for the first hour with heightened moments of almost comical tension leaving the viewer unsure as to when things will spill over into pure horror which it inevitably does and once all the cards are put on the table much of the tension deflates and the situations become more arch and silly from the weak comic relief sidekick subplot to the unnecessary expository villainy all subtly and nuance is suddenly jettisoned at the tap of a teaspoon and peele lowers the bar by overexplaining everything to his audience perhaps the only real sign of his inexperience as a cinematic storyteller

the other major problem with the film is that its too predictable in terms of its plot to fulfill the thriller criteria of shock and surprise there is never much doubt as to what is really happening and that takes away from the experience somewhat but get out is still a nervejangling tale for about an hour and change even though the third act is pure hokum the best way to look at this is as a very twisted guess whos coming to dinner for millennials",positive,8
1439,1439," as an horrorthriller movie it works pretty well it is very well shot very well acted but the whole story is made obvious way too soon to keep us scared by the whole setup said differently what is really going on is way too technical mundane in itself to keep the movie at the same level of anguish horror fantasy

i discussed it with a friend and he gave me a very good explanation of the subtext ie the social commentary most reviewers mistook the premise for a take on racism  while it is definitely about the appropriation of black culture

nobody is racist in this movie they just overtly envy blacks this is just the opposite sin the materialist stance that views other people as a way to enrich your life without giving something back this is not ugly racism this is only class egoism this would be the same with the same affluent wasps having a paternalistic behaviour with poor whites there are movies about this: rich bored guy goes out to have fun with simple peasants then goes back to his comfortable condo with a yearworth of shrink realization only here wasps have a very specific history of poaching on new frontiers and appropriating black culture

so yes despite its strengths and original premise get out covers too much territory from horror to thriller fantasy and social commentary my guess is the social commentary is lost for most except black people but it made for an eerie backdrop which all the same mesmerized most of the viewers",negative,3
1441,1441," my parents are not racist rose tells her boyfriend chris when shes planning to introduce him to her mum and dad shes not planning to tell them chris is black why should she theyre not racist

indeed her parents seem to be more worried about his smoking habit than about his skin colour but the fact remains that they employ two black servants who seem rather submissive and not very talkative

the first part of this film is a clever exploration of race relations chris feels that something strange is going on in the household of his girlfriends parents but he doesnt know what

only in the second half it becomes clear what is going on the movie changes radically: thriller and horror elements take over subtlety makes way for straightforward violence the viewer is treated to a series of bloody killings contrasting strongly with the sophisticated observations about race relations

this is a film with two faces: intelligent drama and bloody horror you could argue that its clever to combine both elements but its also the weak point viewers who dont like horror like me are disappointed by the bloody second half viewers who do will find the first part boring",positive,10
1444,1444," i dont see too many of these type of teen horror movies as they are rarely good or original

there have been a few original ideas that made good small films  it follows was a shining example but get out comes at things quite differently  being both political occasionally funny and appropriately weird

in the end you are presented with a cross between being john malkovich and the lobster with not quite enough developed material to pull it through the performances give it a little gravitas but the ambition tails off

1445,1445," i watched  get out  last night after waiting so long to see it but i have to say that it was so boring that i kept nodding off billed as a horror mystery with a hint of black comedy there was nothing scary about the movie i knew what was going to happen about  minutes into the movie  i didnt find anything remotely amusing in the movie what i will say about the movie is that it is very racist against white people  it tries to make out that all whites are closet racists which is basically the crutch of the movies storyline i did however know something about the movies storyline before viewing it so was expecting this but i didnt find out until after i had viewed the movie that it was directed by a black guy which shines a whole different light on the movie in my opinion as it makes it a racist commentary rather then interesting social commentary

1450,1450," we have seen so many films about racism that we are trained to feel some tension even when we just see a couple of a black man and a white woman in a film get out very cleverly takes advantage of this tension to make it a suspenseful thriller film

the couple visits armitages house again we are trained to suspect there is something behind when we see a white family whose members are friendly to their daughters black boyfriend this suspicion is further encouraged by the excellent cinematography and music makes it a very compelling mystery

pretentiously praising black people is sometimes as disgusting as outright racism and thats what we see in the party scene a guest even says black is in fashion it is fascinating to see the rich and sophisticated old white people hiding some desire behind their friendly smile

although whats happening in the film is horrific and cruel i like how it remains somewhat comedic i think that is partly because of daniel kaluuyas acting which is emotionally restrained and goes along with the films cynical and humorous tone chris is a protagonist who observes things rather than a protagonist who reacts to things also i like rod as a clear comic relief who keeps the film from becoming too serious",positive,7

1452,1452," welcome to a world where you really can judge people by the color of their skin in case you forget which race is superior a character will be sure to inform you and the odd thing they all agree moving past this the film has other issues

i missed the hype just saw this on a recommendation its a well written adaptation of a less well known film skeleton key  unlike the original get out completely fails to be scary part of it is it fails to place us on the protagonist side washington is plenty sympathetic but he lacks that feeling of powerlessness that would make it horror

second it fails to even make it to noir when the films director is clearly on the protagonists side instead of murphys law ruling the twists things tend to happen which are conventient for washington to notice everything going on and be able to do something about it

i dont really have a third there are just little writing things that bugged me all the way through subtle details traits of his character profession etc fail to come into the fold as dominant story arc drivers and are more window dressing

that said the film has some genuinely creepy moments and outside of some extraneous outofsetting scenes with characters who have no narrative impact its mostly believable theres some definite guess whos coming to stepfordness to it all but theres not enough here to forgive it for fanning the flames of racism its an entertaining watch if you have nothing else to see and dont mind being ranted at about the peeles feelings of racial superiority",positive,5

1455,1455," i quite enjoyed this film with a racial slant which was probably unnecessary however the director is tapping in to the sad divisions in the west at the moment which no doubt has boosted views and ratings

the film is quite weird throughout but enjoyable it has been popping up in top rated horrors when i am looking for a film to watch which essentially drew me to the film it in no way should be brought within a best horror film list however as i said the director played to the outrage crowd that will give it high ratings as they pander to the racial divisions of society

the story throughout is intiguing and keeps you watching to the end if you are not keen on classic films like videodrome it white worms lair you will not enjoy this i have done the hard work for you here and do not watch as parts of the film annoy younot as much as thise films though

if you are a movie fan you will want to see this as many will have enjoyed it and i have to say i did eventually it was a bit of a struggle at early points i have to say the young fella daniel kaluuya is brilliant in the role and his friend lil rel howery adds for some decent laughs regarding racial stereotypes

1459,1459, in the film get out by the director jordan peele he uses different methods throughout the film that bring up the painful history of the racism in america the actual suspenseful effect that the film had was very powerful some parts of the movie made me feel like the actions that some of the characters were partaking in were happening to me this film is horrorsuspense based and it is centered by a interracial couple the african american male chris daniel kaluuya and the female rose allison williams the couple had been dating for over some months now and it was time for chris to meet roses parents get out takes you through a various ride of emotions almost feeling like i was connecting to some of the characters at times chris had previous worries about his race towards her parents once they arrived to her parents house and are a bit more settled in chris begins to feel more paranoid on what they are hiding from him as the film goes on in kind of turns into more of a horror film having all of the audience on the edge of their seats jordan peele uses such a unique way of truly attracting the audience to the film considering the music as well the swahili song that gets recognized throughout the whole film by being in the background keeps an ongoing eerie feeling that something bad is yet to come peele does an absolutely outstanding job showing the similarities between all the black characters in the movie at roses parents house in the film the acting is incredible it almost made me forget who the the actors were because they were playing the part of their characters so well one of my favorite parts in the movie shows how i was able to connect to some of the racial stereotypes chris was facing during a family party at roses parents house at some times jordan peele throws in some of his comedic sense of humor at some of the almost screeching horrific parts of the film get out brings up the sad and hurtful passed of racism but also it connects to the way chris feels when he is in the sunken place because he felt like he had no control over what was going on same with the racism in the past and how many african americans were being controlled this film also connects back to an older suspenseful like horror film called the shining jordan peele was very inspired by this movie because it gave get out more twisted clues at times that no one would notice until the second time they watch it from the beginning to the end of the movie peele has everyone on their toes horrified on whats to come a reference to another directorauthor that couldve been used to make this film wouldve been stephen king just because he makes horror films that include some comedic features that seep through during some of the more suspenseful parts of the film some ways jordan peele couldve made this movie more prestigious is if he hadnt had the funny black tsa character rod who is chriss friend stop out of the police car to save chris but instead have actual police officers step out while he is in the middle of trying to save himself from rose this change wouldve made the whole audience stand up in anger and start to yell at the characters to try and help them this will forever be one of my recent favorite horror films it gave me all the emotions one could have within an hour and forty five minutes until jordan peele comes out with another movie that matches this one it will be on the top of the scale in my mind and in the category of suspenseful films as well i am pretty positive the whole audience was pleased after watching this incredible film it was definitely worth the wait and seeing it in the theater get out is highly recommended to watch and then watch it again and notice the little things that show some of the hidden secrets that show what they are hiding at the end,positive,10

1465,1465," but it just wasnt my cup of tea i think a lot of white liberals and progressives are lying about what they thought of the film i say this as a white lefty who felt compelled to lie about what i thought when i first saw the film heres my honest opinion:

i think the only reason the film got so much attention was because of white guilt and atonement for the oscars neglect of black filmmakers and artists its really easy for white people to go to the film and sing its praises in order to show how woke they are but thats incredibly dishonest the film is cynical and stigmatizes interracial relationships its super manipulative the black characters are painted as helpless victims while the white people are all painted as evil villains this idea that people of color in interracial relationships are being entrapped by white people into interracial relationships is intellectually lazy

i did appreciate the satirizing of northern wasps who would have voted for obama a third time if they could have when i tell people im from the south i get enough looks of pity andor you dont have an accent comments to understand how insufferable these types of people can be jordan peele clearly seems to have a lot of experience with these sort of elite circles he grew up on the upper west side and went to sarah lawrence so i cant really knock him for writing a film about what he knows

but films should be evaluated on the strength of their writing and the acting not because they are serving to assuage peoples white guilt or as an antidote to hollywoods overwhelming whiteness there have been plenty of great black films directors actors and actresses that are light years better than what we are presented with in get out",negative,3

the only reason this movie got oscar nominations because is because the main actor is black and the director is black thats all they dont deserve it by any means it is a comedy where cops dont give a dn about a missing person and they laugh at you where a cop cant talk seriously

also if you walk on the street and someone is looking at you from the other side you can somehow just feel and you will turn there this happens all the time with every single person on earth there are like  and the main actor doesnt notice anything beside that the black fellas are acting weirdly what

get out is the directorial debut of africanamerican jordan peele who also wrote the script and who is an actor and comedian as well as a filmmaker following an opening sequence which is only explained at the end we join black chris daniel kaluuya and his white girlfriend rose allison williams on a trip to meet her parents whom we are told are obamasupporting liberals so what could possibly go wrong the title hints that plenty could  and it does in a work that could have been called except the title has already been used there will be blood

1479,1479," its fairly rare these days that a horror movie gets the kind of critical praise that it receives and get out which marks the directorial debut of jordan peele has managed to somehow pull off just that this having been said peele has called his movie a social thriller but lets face facts its a horror movie and a rather mediocre one at that starring daniel kaluuya who incidentally i previously know from his role as tealeaf in the cult british horrorcomedy tv series psychoville the film centres around a young black man who goes to meet the affluent parents of his white girlfriend upon meeting the potential husband to be finds something unsettling about the unnatural friendliness of the father and as the day progresses he begins to learn some disturbing truths by which time it might already be too late

although a tad rough around the edges which i could forgive that being that this was the directorial debut of jordan peele who also wrote the screenplay it still however gets off to a strong start and theres an intriguing setup with a potent air of mystery and a quiet unease which is palpably felt early on it also easy to see shades of ira levins the stepford wives and kevin smiths red state where i think its fairly safe to say peele was influenced by serving as a satirical allegory very much in a similar vein of the stepford wives of post racial tensions in the us any sharp observations it attempts to make end up playing second fiddle to its horror movie elements and even then when those start to come to the fore the movie lacks any real tension i simply didnt feel as if i was on the edge of my seat quite like i was supposed to be

the occasional humorous moments with the lead characters best friend doesnt really gel with the whole tone of the movie and it really beings to lose it in the final third where it descends in to sloppily handled clich√© ridden fodder worse yet the family are so aloof and cold within the context of how the story plays out to the point that its laughable add to this a tacked on denouement which given that there was an alternate original ending and its more than apparent that its being clumsily shoehorned in

despite all this there are some some wonderful performances with both bradley whitford and catherine keener being unnervingly cleancut and buttoned down parents with stephen root also on top form the standout however is daniel kaluuya who makes for a likable and charismatic protagonist who manages to understatedly invoke the sense of paranoia and threat that he feels sadly although not terrible he really deserved better to work with in terms with than what feels like something of a wasted opportunity as social commentaries go it just doesnt hold entirely together well as it should although to be fair this is not the worst attempt at melding social commentary with the horror genre with director brian yuznas awful  effort society taking the number one spot this is the citizen kane of horror movies in comparison",positive,10

1504,1504," wow i can summarize this film without any reference to racism original horror creative writing etc by saying its simply another version of hollywood overhype how the public takes this below average crap and runs with it is beyond me i can imagine with the unreal deluge of sequels trilogy and remakes that original writing is at a premium but it doesnt mean you have to settle for nonsense and label it an achievement go back and watch your favorite horror movie again for the th time dont waste a st on the overhyped

1507,1507," get out is an instant classic i had no idea what i was getting into when sitting down to watch this but i was interested to see what jordan peele had in store i love horror films that try not to focus on the scary aspects rather they will focus on the overall ambiance of the film setting up events that will happen later on i also want to point out that the movie has its fair share of humor and it really works get out is amazingly made

1509,1509," this movie was just ok same story line as the skeleton key but the skeleton key was much better i am not sure why this movie is getting so much hype when it is literally a knock off i know it is hard to come up with new ideas i only suggest watching this for the comparison

1511,1511, its my first review and im not that good in writing in english but i have to write this review why because this is the first case of watching two films in one at least for the films ive seen ill divide film in two parts because at a certain point well basically have a change of genre and a totally different film from first part my rating for first part of the film is  im not kidding first part is awesome ill tell later where this part ends and starts delirium rating for nd part delirium maybe author delirium dont know but i would like to know who smoked what is  so  its  cant go on without spoil so from this point on the review will contain spoilers first part as i said its awesome its thrilling you dont know what to expect but youll understand that something isnt good with that family and protagonist will understand with you youll feel a bit of panic youll fear your gf mother and maybe a bit more your gf father oh wait i was talking about the film the point is: the film will get your attention now the spoiler: the film will drastically fall after the protagonist asked for car keys to her gf im not kidding again nd part starts in this moment i loved how it turned out that gf wasnt that sweet but then second part starts it becomes a scifi frankestein based about a mad scientist with a mad family and mad relatives i would like to know how protagonist put cotton in his ears too wasnt he tied and why he casually started killing atmosphere was saying he is afraid he wants to escape not he is afraid he wants to kill kill kill im really sad to say that second part of this film is i wont say that word ill just say bad really bad film had potential wasted,positive,5
1513,1513," it would of been better i think if they showed one black person in the group because it would of showed the lengths rich people would go to to stay young remember all the white people looking at chris was hurt  old or blind etc where as chris was young and healthy how many people hete wouldnt do the same if they could to live another healthy  years a very good movie that everyone should see

1515,1515, this was the directorial debut of jordan peele who then went on to create us  and co produce hunters the plot is a back man meeting his white girlfriends parents to stay there for a while this is the best example of slowburn done right a lot of people hate slow films because usually it drags on without anything interesting happening this does slightly drag on but doing so manages to brilliantly add more tension each scene from unsettling house keepers a creepy brother gatherings and strange talks with the parents all of this resulting in a highly intelligent twist that will leave you scratching your head and also allows people to create their own theories on it several amazing details hidden in the scenes will have you coming back to watch again eyeing the screen for clues daniel kaluuya did a fantastic performance along with the rest of the cast especially caleb landry jones playing a very off and strange character pretty much perfectly the humor is just right in this film as well some may say its a horror comedy i somewhat agree but it adds enough laughs to keep it well above entertaining but doesnt ruin the creepy vibe throughout the film either i was shocked how this was the guy behind key and peele making it a bigger achievement honestly everything about the film was great but sorry this review was rather short if you havent watched this please do verdict: humor excellent foreshadowing and scares make this a horror film worth watching more than once get out gets a big fat a,negative,2
1516,1516," a beautiful and psychological horror film who know a guy who was fantastic at comedy was an alfred hitchcock of our modern time as a horror director jordan peele has truly made some fantastic thing so far and i truly cant wait to see what he has next in the store for us but dont just take my word for it see this film yourself its an entertaining piece of art dont miss it if you have been under a rock and havent seen it

1517,1517," this movie had a really interesting premise and delivered it perfectly the pacing was slow which added to the suspense and mystery of the story the performances were good the directing was excellent and this film had me still thinking about it several days later i would highly recommend it as it is a great horror movie with an enticing original story
