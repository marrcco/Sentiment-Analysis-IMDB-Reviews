1,"9/10 | Interesting movie about an interracial couple who decide to go for the weekend to visit the girl's parents, the boyfriend Chris starts noticing odd behaviors from the African Americans house workers and what started as a fun relaxing weekend slowly turns into a living nightmare for him.

The idea is original and interesting, the acting was good by all but I felt that Daniel Kaluuya was not emotional enough and his reactions was too cold in many scenes! but generally speaking the movie is well paced from all aspects yet I won't call this a horror in anyway, to me it's no more than a psychological suspense thriller...it gets tense but never scary.

The movie has its share of racism that can't go unnoticed but it's not too much, mainly stereotypical yet I believe that the concept of the plot can executed on any race, which clearly hinted in Stephen Root's final scene. An open minded audience can go throw it, enjoy it without any care for its racism.

2,"5/10 | I decided to see this film at the theater after hearing some of the hype (which was basically that it is an excellent horror film that is told from the perspective of a black man).

Well, I can see this would be truly the worst nightmare of a black man (and really the worst nightmare for us all). This is NOT a film that tries to make the viewer feel ""sorry"" for black people, nor is it at all preachy, but it is just a good old fashioned horror film with a fresh new setting. I'm an old white guy by the way.

The acting is wonderful, and directing is amazing. The film, while mostly horror, is actually completely hilarious in some parts, making it the funniest AND scariest movie I have seen in ages (no easy feat). It is a shame that the film will likely not be regarded in the company of Academy Award potential nominees, because the directing and acting is honestly Oscar worthy. Again, no small feat for a horror movie that is also funny.

In summary, this is a MUST SEE at the theater and one of the best films of the year. It is a fun ride that is very well done!"

4,"5/10 | Let's clear the air about this film. It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves.

8,"1/10 | I was totally blown away by ""Get Out"". This is one of the best turns by an actor behind the camera I have ever seen (Jordan Peele). Probably the timely social commentary is going to loom heavily when discussing the film; however this shouldn't conceal the fact that this is a masterclass cinematic work that has been thought out to the very last detail; it knows what it wants to say and how to say it, balancing wildly contrasting tones and defeating potential clichés with stylistic bravura. Of course everything stems from a rock solid script, where the plot points are cunningly engineered, and then fleshed out in a disciplined and take no prisoners kind of way. There is much to admire and enjoy here, including some surreal imagery that is as stunning as it is disturbing, always serving a purpose within the narrative; there are also brilliant soundtrack choices and you get subtle nods at the masters that came before (Kubrick and Wes Craven, specially). The plot involves one of those frequently visited ""fish out of the water"" type of settings where it's up to the director to make the most out of it. Which fortunately is the case here, since you get plenty of real character development and a tight, innuendo ridden dialogue that really gets under your skin. All this, together with the inspired camera work, contributes to the success of this tricky enterprise as a whole. Kudos to all the actors for going all the way with the provocative premise, considering that it could have totally backfired in less confident hands. Everything amounts to a deliciously wry slice of cinematic paranoia served with a side of cathartic humor that appropriately reflects the political times we are living in. And make no mistake, this is a true horror film that refuses to pull any punches; if you thought that Peele was just going for the laughs and the cheap scares you will get more than you bargained for. ""Get out"" will shock you silly and will make you think. Then you will want to watch it again and try to figure out how he pulled the trick."

10,"1/10 | Short review. If the races were switched as to whom was the predator and whom was the prey, there would be national outrage and this would be a boycotted and hidden film. There are limits, in my personal opinion, when you become too psychological, too propagandizing, in narratives that are inappropriate for society. With an age that is strongly pushing an anti-cop, racist, and white-privilege tone I could not get past the obvious intentions to shape, or at least strongly influence, public thought towards problems that back-room backers seem to spare no opportunity to not be involved in to achieve societal perceptions. I get tired of the double standards that exist where for some, it is OK to unfairly demonize a race depending on which race it is. I largely reject the anticipated arguments of lavish praise for efforts based on history that simply is not the present, or simple artistic expression. When America is a place where all methods of ""artistic expression"", or religious expression for that matter, are equally protected and not shut up based on threat of violence, advertiser boycotts, or ""hate speech"", perhaps I might change my views. This movie, to me, was as clear of an attempt to hide anti-white propaganda under a guise and found the film to be disgusting and racist. Racism towards white people is not ""reverse racism"" (the term alone being another evidence of how skewed society has become) or somehow different than any racism towards any race. This is racist. Plenty of films have been banned, boycotted, and protested for doing much less than the rampant anti-white themes throughout this film.. and yet, due to prevailing voices, racism is indeed alive and well as the film broadly wishes to convince viewers of.. only not in the way intended by the production team."
11,"1/10 | In this era of disposable entertainment where we have no cultural memory (and, I fear, no cultural future), and people are living only for the next best thing, is there no one who recognizes that this movie is almost a head-on remake of Ira Levin's The Stepford Wives (1975)? Substitute racism for sexism and mix liberally, no credit given to the original author. The fact that not even the Academy could recognize the wholly derivative plot shows how far we have fallen as a moviegoing public. In all likelihood, even Jordan Peale probably believes he wrote an original script. He didn't. And that's what's terrifying about Get Out.

12,"3/10 | A rip off of The Skeleton Key. The fact that Peele stood there at the Academy Awards all emotional in his speech, acting like he wrote the script is ridiculous. Universal made both pictures, that's why there's no plagiarism law suit. It's a good story (TSK is a much better movie though) and with the gender and ethnicity of the main characters switched (white girl vs black family doing vodoo in the Skeleton Key) and after Oscars So White, it hit the Zeitgeist. That's fine. But Best ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY for Peele? What a joke....

14,"2/10 | This movie is absolute garbage. The only acting worth mentioning is the main character's and the overall plot seems to be written by an angry black teenager. The ""racism"" theme you find here isnt anything related to the real world like 12 Years a Slave or Django Unchained. I have no idea what granted Peele an Oscar for this film. Ive seen B movies much better than this and seeing someone go from comedy to Director you'd be 100 times better off watching A Quiet Place directed by John Krasinski. This movie left me feeling annoyed in the fact that ive wasted money and time on it; even The Emoji Movie is more entertaining than Get Out. Save yourself and read a synopsis and skip the actual watching part. 0/10 if i could give it.

17,"1/10 | Horror tension, mystery tension and racial tension blend together into a gripping and formidable nail-biter in ""Get Out,"" the astonishing directorial debut of Jordan Peele. The former half of the comedy duo ""Key & Peele"" has found a way to both honor and subvert the thriller and horror genres in a way that's unmistakably modern.

In the tradition of ""The Stepford Wives"" with the twist of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?,"" the story follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) who goes to meet his girlfriend, Rose's (Allison Williams) parents at their fancy estate where things go from slightly uncomfortable in terms of Chris being black to deeply messed up in one slow but inevitable fell swoop.

With a creepy opening scene showing a different black man getting abducted in a peaceful-seeming suburb, the tone is set immediately that there's cause for concern. Luckily for Chris, Rose is really sensitive to issues of race and prejudice, and even when her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) or brother (Caleb Landry Jones) seem to make Chris' blackness into a thing, the two handle it as best as any interracial couple could. The warning signs come in the form of the Armitage family's black help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson), whose behavior is anything but normal.

Peele sets a tone of creepiness largely with the help of composer Michael Abels, also making his feature film debut. The unpredictable nature of Georgina and Walter as characters, the ever-increasing suspicion of all the white characters and the way Peele keeps you nervous about who or what is just outside the frame fuel the fear and paranoia as well as if not better than any horror movie featuring more overtly malevolent forces does.

Kaluuya, in a role that will deservedly put him on the map, gives a performance that will connect with viewers who identify with Chris as a man trying to feel comfortable while out of his element experiencing strange things, and those who truly understand Chris' experience as a man of color undergoing the very same events. It would be fascinating to know the different ways a black viewer would experience the film compared to a white one, but the most important thing is that everyone will identify with and feel for Chris.

When a little horror film debut like this one gets talents such as Whitford, Keener and Williams, you know the script is good. Peele keeps up the air of mystery a long time even without packing in very many unexpected twists. The awareness of something being wrong but not quite understanding what it going on or why despite getting new information is a real strength of Peele's writing. Then of course there's the brilliant ways that race and the black experience make it into the film. If that weren't enough, Chris' best friend (LilRel Howry) provides comic relief in a way that's stereotypical, yet Peele uses him in unexpected ways. So we get to benefit from Peele's nose for comedy as well.

Not everything adds up by the end of ""Get Out,"" but the film plays out in extremely satisfying fashion. Fans of horror and fans of thrillers who don't mind horror when it's done well should both enjoy the technique and experience. It provides thrills of the pulse-pounding, thrill-seeking and thought-provoking variety and few genre films can say the same.

19,"8/10 | First of all, in order for you to enjoy a horror movie, you need to relate with the protagonist. The main character in this movie keeps on the same dull and lifeless expression throughout most of the movie, like he is constantly lost in his own thoughts. Even when someone comes out of the woods running at him full speed, he remains there frozen, staring into the void. The plot twist is easy to anticipate early on. This makes the second half of the movie boring and tedious. Actually, you know who the bad guys are half hour in the movie, it's really easy since there are no good guys apparently. Finally, this movie took the concept of Skeleton Key and replaced magic with science and blacks with whites.

And if you ask why this movie has high ratings, is because of modern politics. Every single white person is portrayed as evil and envious of black people, in every aspect. Skin colour, muscles, talent, even eyes. Thus, critics gave it high ratings.

20,"8/10 | I'll say right off the bat, I didn't really know who Jordan Peele was coming into this movie. I knew he had a show with Keegan-Michael Key and was a comedian of sorts. What I didn't know was that hiding underneath all that was a genuine fan of classic horror just waiting to get out.

Get Out surprised me for a number of reasons. The first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that It truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is.

And secondly this was the work of a first time director. It's rare that you get a movie written and directed by the same person on their first attempt and they manage to hit it out of the park.

And lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.

Is it a perfect movie? No it isn't, but it's damn good especially if you're in the mood for a good psychological thriller with horror overtones."
21,"5/10 | Fantastic! I would not call it ""horror"" but certainly ""thriller"" with some comedy thrown into it. This Jordan Peele fellow has managed to bring something new to this genre and I certainly hope he'll do more thrillers.

The cast is great and I especially enjoyed Betty Gabriels performance. Lots of faces I have never seen before and they all did a stellar job. And those faces I have seen before did a stellar job, too. =)

I do not know if the overall idea is new but the way it was presented and the way it was done feels very fresh.

Warmly recommended!

22,"3/10 | Get out, is no doubt a fine horror film, but it ain't anything special. A young black man visit along with his white girlfriend her parents. It's pretty obvious shortly that this is a very politicial horror film, based on very stupid liberal agenda. And the only reason this movie was made, was to please the new PC generation. Like I said it's a ok. horror film, nothing more.

24,"1/10 | 'Get Out' is a disappointing and highly overrated movie that fails to meet even the most basic expectations of a horror/thriller. It lacks any real scares, is generally ineffective in its attempts to be creepy, and many of the would-be thrills fall flat due to the fact that the plot is, for the most part, completely predictable with many of the plot 'twists' glaringly obvious.

To most viewers, it will be fairly obvious what is going to happen in this movie from very early on, and so the big 'twists' really don't have any impact at all. I was sat there waiting for something that I hadn't seen coming - a smart and well-disguised twist that all decent thrillers have, but it never arrived.

Even to the very last scene, 'Get Out' is so predictable and never even attempts to think out of the box, resulting in a rather dull, boring and forgettable thriller.

27,"1/10 | There is no way this movie could have a rating over 6. There is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING NEW in this movie, no new concept, a fest of cliches, even the twist was almost a copy of another movie ""Skeleton Key"", which I did not enjoy even. And if a movie calls its own genre ""thriller"" or ""horror"", then the movie should keep some level of atmosphere, to make the audience tense up to some point. Not saying that the atmosphere was even there, it was made even worse by inserting some random jokes in between the movies, which of course wasn't even humorous. And the character development was the worst thing in this movie, as some character shows passionate caring attitude and all of the sudden he/she turns into a complete psychopath. It was so abrupt that he/she would even change the way he/she speaks to a person that's not even supposed to know something happened. One of the key evidence that this movie was made without brains.

Let's just be honest. The movie makers only cared about making profit. Mixing horror, comedy, and not forgetting to insert white-is-evil rich-is-evil theme inside with a black person as main, so that you can call all negative reviewers ""racist"" (and sorry, I'm not even white). Then using some way to make people spam positive reviews, most of them which I highly doubt even saw the movie. I honestly think more effort, money was spent on making positive reviews rather than the movie itself. Hence the ""low budget"" movie."

31,"1/10 | This movie is appropriately in a genre Mr. Jordan Peele has christened, ""Social Thriller"". The movie creates a very unsettling feeling from the beginning that slowly builds to a crescendo, that forces the viewer to see prejudices head on. When all is said and done, you now have kind of a bird's eye view of what is wrong with society. But besides that, it hints a Hitchcock-type of thrill that is sure to deliver Goosebumps. A HUGE congratulations to Jordan Peele for hitting a HOME RUN, his first time up to bat. Looking forward to future projects from him. GO SEE, GET OUT. 😀😀

33,"5/10 | I can't believe the high score on this film. I'm a massive film fan and this is one of my favorite genres so trust me when I say this is very very overrated. The humor falls short and it is not scary in the slightest. Let's be honest, this is the same propaganda that is in the news right now with the black lives matter and Trump rubbish. This is highly irresponsible and offensive to any white person and if the film was the other way around with whites and blacks then there would be a massive backlash. How many films now play the race or sexism card now?! This film is a blatant rip off of Skeleton Key but Skeleton Key is actually a good film so ignore all the reviews on this film cause I can't help but think it just mirrors the sad state of the victim mentality and racism that is all the rage right now. Avoid!!

34,"1/10 | This movie received incredible reviews at the time of release and so I watched it with great anticipation. However I was hugely disappointed. It is nothing more than a run of the mill horror with a nasty, thinly veiled message beneath it that all white people are racists. Whilst the premise is interesting, it is played like it's either a pastiche or an Am Dram production with a hint of Hammer Horror. The plot has no surprises and by half way through it has become boring.

36,"8/10 | Ok here goes. Having read the reviews and seeing how polarized they were,, I had to check the movie out myself. To all who regard the movie as racist - I don't think so. Any modern day theme be it racism, sexism, disability issues anything can be used in this movie to highhight the issues being faced by individuals. It is for most part a unique genre in its own right. Take dusk till dawn mix it with some eugenics and a pinch of humour and bingo . Yes it does make you feel uncomfortable but not in a serious way. It's funny in places and very clever in bits. Some beautiful shots and filming and menacing score keep it simmering brilliantly. Watch it make your own mind up. Personally one of the most enjoyable movies from last year. Bravo.

40,3/10 | the newest film made by jordan peele lives out to the hype that it made.horror comedy is one of the hardest genres(or sub genres) to make a movie about.some good examples would be evil dead 2 and scream.the film actually takes a subject like racism and makes it into a parody of itself.the comedy of the movie is actually really subtle and your'e not gonna walk into the movie and start laughing as a joke comes along.its a realization that can be made while watching the film or after you watched it.it can't be really called a satire of horror movies because it uses the horror movie clichés more than once but the good part is that i doesn't annoy you like a lot of horror movies do.one of the strengths of the movie is that you don't need to be an American to understand the story.a basic knowledge about racism will be enough.but for the clues and metaphors that are in the movie you need to pay more attention and know a little bit more.there are no jokes in the movie and even the comedy relief character lil rel howery doesn't make jokes but sells its comedy by his performance which makes him actually funny and not just an annoying side character like we see mostly in the movies right now.the performances are great and the character choices are rational and logical unlike most horror movies we see today.allison williams does a pretty good job and actually nails the character far more better than i expected.the cinematography is pretty good but it got distracting in two or three places of the movie but it wasn't boring and actually kept the movie pretty good looking.the twists of the movie will actually kinda predictable but that wasn't what the movie was about and i didn't expected to be shocked since the movie doesn't take itself to seriously but serious enough to keep the plot going.the CGI blood were kinda distracting and the movie got slow in a few places but it had the pay-off and you were rewarded after the scenes.the movie is well made and deserves a second viewing in some time and i would recommend it to horror fans or if your'e a fan of subtle humor and comedy.
41,"1/10 | The trailers and commercials looked awful, but the reviews were great. So I went to see the movie. I was expecting something like an intellectual version of ""Scary Movie."" Nope. It was incredibly boring. Maybe the worst movie I've seen in five years. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever did. I kept wondering, ""How the hell did this movie get such good reviews?"" ""Get Out"" was supposed to be a horror-comedy, but I got maybe three chuckles out of it. The only guy who was close to being funny was the TSA agent. Almost nothing was scary. Damn, I could have seen Skull Island instead.

That said, everyone else in the theater seemed to love the movie, and there was some subtle humor that I thought was well done. Still, I found it very monotonous.

Apparently there is a market for such drivel based on the sanctimonious preaching in many of the pontificating '10's' posted here. Gave it every chance.... but they kept digging a political hole deeper and deeper leaving entertainment to die a painful death here. Peele has done so much better. This..... truly the worst of his 'message movies'.... deserves no further mention.... ever.

There's nothing new, or refreshing about this horrible ""movie"". It's no better than a WWII Nazi propaganda film. There's no ""social commentary"" in this atrocious excuse of a movie, BUT it's definitely riddled with racist agitprop. It's like an SJW's version of Orwell's ANIMAL FARM...""Black people gooood...white people baaaad!"". Instead of creating a film that would help revitalize a quickly stagnating genre, Jordan Peele has created nothing more than a piece of propagating filth. Rather than trying to make a film showing the unity of the human race, he drives a wedge of contention between the races...further fueling bigotry, and hate. It's pompousness, and arrogance that strokes the flames, NOT genius. If I could rate this drivel less than 1, I would. Stay far, far away from this!!!

46,"1/10 | Get Out, no really, Get out...

So, I went to see the movie Get Out with some friends yesterday. We had a choice between Leggo Batman and Get Out, and we chose Get Out. We're still arguing about who should be blamed for that choice. They list it as a horror. What they don't tell you is that the horror is that someone would even make this movie. I've never seen any of Jordan Peele's movies before this. I will spend the rest of my life trying to avoid ever seeing one of his movies again. The thing strives to be one of those Sixth Sense ""What a twist!"" movies, but the so called twists are so obvious, unrealistic and just flat out lame that you find yourself rolling your eyes in the dark and just praying that no more twists are coming. And they always are. If you were to take the racial premise in this movie and reverse it, there would be pickets and riots. But apparently it's perfectly acceptable to have a white people are evil and black people are good movie. Just for the record, I'm only part white. But I'm fully offended by the premise of this movie, not to mention in the clumsy and lazy execution that doesn't bother to try to make its plot points make any sense. To be fair, the trailer to Get Out does hint that this could either be a very good movie or one of the worse that you've ever seen. It comes far close to the latter and is too lazy to ever even approach the former possibility. This movie really does suck. It sucks despite some very good actors, including Catherine Keener, who has been superb in indie films like Your Friends and Neighbors and Bradley Whitford, an Aaron Sorkin favourite. The lead actor Daniel Kaluuya was even in the wonderful British series The Fades and Skins. And yet the net result, the only result is just flat out stupid and predictable. Maybe the title, Get Out, is meant as a warning to any potential audience. But probably not. That would require too much effort and self awareness. But the rest of us can try to help each other out in these days when going to the movies is more expensive in most places than drugs, and gives you far less pleasure. When in comes to Get Out, please, please, for your own stakes... Stay out... Go see Leggo Batman. I haven't seen it. But I wish I had."
47,"9/10 | I should have Got Out before the movie started..

I am shocked by the high ratings this got. Seems like a case of the Emperor's New Clothes to me. It wasn't as clever, certainly nowhere near as funny or even scary as reviews led us (wife, me) to believe. Very disappointing...

48,"8/10 | Get Out is full of touches and surprises, strong acting, excellent direction, and above it, it's a ride, a trip to a place Hollywood doesn't normally go - it offers a unique experience - and in this age of copycat, cookie cutter safe choice cinema, it stands out by a mile.

Get Out is that rare beast - a film that leaves you satisfied yet pondering. We objected to its constant referral as a horror film - it's an effective thriller with mild horror elements - but it is not a gore/slasher movie - this is more about getting under the skin, and inside the mind, of the viewer.

The plot is simple: girlfriend takes boyfriend home. Home is not what home seems to be. Fun ensues. The genius of this is the way it plays on both white and black perceptions - we asked how the film would be if you reversed all the roles (pretty darn effective) etc;

Get out and see it."

50,"10/10 | This movie in a word... TERRIBLE.

If you want to see a comedy, go see a comedy. If you want to see a horror, go see a horror. This movie claiming to be both of those things is an insult to both genres. There is NO comedy or horror to be seen here.

There's got to be a way to explain the 'hype' and positive reviews about this boring movie. I think it's mostly because critics wouldn't dare hate on as it would label them racist.

You have the feeling this is about the director, up on his soapbox, expressing his racism towards whites. But, hey, its seems it's OK for them to do that. They get applauded for it.

To sum up - Boring, Dull, Slow, Very Predictable (I saw the plot unfolding a mile away) Not funny or scary. Total waste of a Saturday night."

58,"1/10 | Jordan Peele's directorial debut is an exhilarating horror thriller that also manages to spark laughter and comment on social issues. The cinematography, tropes, and soundtrack echo horror, but the film finds abundant moments of comic relief like when a father reassures the main character he isn't racist by claiming, ""I would have voted for Obama for a third term."" Before the plot delves into a traditional horror frenzy, it mines the horrors of racism. The social commentary plays on audience expectations and results in both humor and suspense. Delivering both on the expectations of the genre and the comedic expectations of a Jordan Peele creation, GET OUT is simply amazing.

59,"1/10 | I went in expecting a knockout of a horror movie ...with a bit of humor in it according to the description and some word of mouth reviews. ...I barely made it through the entire movie. Really bad writing, directing and acting, although I like the two leads. It was nothing better than a mid-range episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits; the comedy fell just as flat as the story for me ...it came off as completely forced; not funny at all.

60,"10/10 | I feel so sorry for myself after trying out this movie. The reviewers gave it good scores, but since this movie was injected with a million different ways to make white people look racist and tons of sexual innuendo between our handsome male lead and our resident sexy white girl, I guess it would have been politically incorrect for reviewers to have even a microscopic sized spine to criticize it. I mean hell, are you into like toe-nail fetishes? Femdom? you might like a scene or two, but the rest will give you cancer.

I can honestly say, this movie's writing is worse than anything I've seen before. Twilight? Yeah. It's worse. The acting is almost as bad, especially from the supporting cast. But really it's just everything about the writing, I bet I could have written a better film when I was in 4th grade. I am writing this review so that you don't waste your time. Please don't waste your time. Please. Avoid like the plague, not worth even 1 star, piece of horse crap of a film.

For the record, I didn't make it past the first 25 minutes, I don't care what happens after that, I already lost 25 minutes I'll never get back to the worst writing I've ever witnessed. Everyone involved in this film should be ASHAMED. They should have just made a porno with the two lead actors."
61,"1/10 | Jordan Peele is a man best known as one half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, so when I first heard the news that he'd written and directed a horror film, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little surprised. Then came reports that Get Out was getting ridiculously good feedback from test screenings and, after horror having a solid year in 2016, I was hoping it'd live up to expectations. Believe the hype guys because Get Out is as good as you've heard.

Black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) visit Rose's parents for the weekend, where they will meet Chris for the very first time. Staggered by their behaviour from the very off, Chris begins to think all is not right in the home of Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener).

I absolutely loved Get Out as both a psychological and satirical horror, Jordan Peele's imagination bringing us something quite unique within the genre and showing that he has such a big future ahead as a filmmaker. Right from the opening sequence, which is one of the best openings to a horror I've seen, I knew this film was going to be special. It felt almost as if I was watching a film from a seasoned director and not a man making his directorial debut, Peele exuding confidence more and more as the film rises through the levels of paranoia.

The writing is spot on as well, Peele's background as a comedian coming into great use to blend the satire so perfectly with the horror. Peele has clearly made Get Out as a form of social commentary but he does so by keeping the audience on their toes, wondering where the film will turn next, which is one of the most important aspects of a horror film. As well as being genuinely creepy, Get Out also has some hilarious moments up its sleeve, leaving the audience in the palm of Peele's hand.

Peele's confidence as a filmmaker is seen further through Toby Oliver's swift cinematography, akin to work seen in The Shining, and both Michael Abels haunting score and songs picked by Peele to accompany his twisted film.

Coming to the performances, Get Out excels above many horror films with a talented and strong cast. Daniel Kaluuya leads the film with a quite exceptional performance as Chris Washington, impressing with each passing minute as the paranoia within his character grows. Expect to see much more of Kaluuya in the future.

Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are both devilishly charming and unnerving with their performances as Rose's parents, who take an immediate interest in Chris' life, both past and present. Get Out gets its truly unsettling performances from Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson as Georgina and Walter, hired by Dean's father. They both have a stand-out scene where it becomes clear that all is not well with either them or the house they tend to. Lil Rel Howery deserves a mention too for being genuinely funny in the role of Chris' best friend, Rod, who doesn't just feel like the comedy relief shoehorned in for the sake of it.

Get Out brilliantly continues the resurgence of the horror genre and, as a directorial debut, has to go down as of the best I've seen from Jordan Peele. He's already stated that this is the first of a number of horrors he has planned which will act as social commentaries and, if they continue to be as good as his debut, I cannot wait."
62,"1/10 | Bad, cringe worthy acting. Stereotypical behavior which is insulting to black people. The movie expects all black man apparently to act like thugs among another. Calling each other brother and giving fist bumps and calling women bitches. Full of product placement. All the computers and phones used in the movie are from the same brand. Low level of humour (transformers movie level), which does appeal to the mass audience but not any self respecting intelligent human being. Very boring, keeps you waiting for something to happen. It is all a mess.

Do not waste your time watching the movie. It is much to highly rated.

65,"9/10 | Daniel K is a good actor with his perfect portrayal of the character Chris. The movie wasn't scary to be frank but more entertaining than most horror movies. Each scene in the movie means a thousand words.

Allison Williams also played a great role as the movie villain ranging from an innocent woman who dates a black guy to a crazy and monstrous woman ready to kill to have her victim's colored body hosted by older non-blacks.

In all, the movie was entertaining and covered the area of racial discrimination in the United States in a creative, plot twisting way. I recommend this movie for all , from going to old.

66,"1/10 | Actually if we're not talking about characters in the movie, but the viewers of the movie, I urge you to stay and watch. This is a clever horror comedy, that does play with the viewers expectations and is also a powerful message. You could almost say a social commentary. But it's really about having fun at the movies.

And one character especially is very entertaining and does everything he can to keep things light. The combination of being funny but also scary is a difficult one, but the movie walks that fine line very nicely. Some people took issue with the theme and the bad guys in this and how or rather what they represented. But if you really have issues with that, than the issue lies within yourself. It's a completely different thing not liking a movie because you're just not into it and one arguing it is unfair to you in its depiction ... you've revealed much about yourself I'd say.

It was about time someone made a movie like this and it sets a pretty high standard! Great script, great performances, a nail-biter ..."

Just more racist Communist SJW cult nonsense.

The media says it's 99% awesome though, which is unfortunate, because the movie never really gets a laugh bigger than that Wag the Dog joke.

In fact, if you absolutely must watch a ""hate whitey"" horror comedy Tales From the Hood is a much, much better choice.

69,"1/10 | This is the worst movie I've seen in several years at least. The movie starts off slow but somewhat interesting. As soon as the plot gets going 30 minutes into the movie it's just completely ridiculous. If you know anything about hypnosis or basic logic you won't be able to watch this movie. The writer doesn't even attempt to makes sense or isn't capable of doing so. My girlfriend and I both had enough after 30-40 minutes. In the past 30 years this is maybe the 3rd movie I couldn't watch till the end.

70,"8/10 | The genius of this movie was all the hype about it and the sheep who fed the hype. I looked at a few sites to see what it was rated and figured my wife and I like some psychological horror... why not. Genius movie on an epic level for me even though I rated it 1 star out of 10. The true genius of this movie is showing to my wife and I how alone we are in this world/country and that we're surrounded by a minority of actual humans but now a majority of sheep. I am so honored to have watched this movie to now see so clearly this visceral portrait of America's idiocy unfolding.

When the movie ended and it faded to black and those powerful words ""Get Out"" came up, I knew right then and there that this blockbuster of a movie had finally solidified my mind into knowing I am surrounded by imbecilic sheep out there. I had once doubted and thought maybe it was my age of 45 starting to show through and thinking ""Man, am I getting old? Is this how it starts?"" but this movie transcends all age restrictions. Stupidity and zombie-like hype needs no age, no race, no culture ... it can shuffle forward slowly like a plague and consume more and more as we tick tock through the years to come.

Bravo!"
71,"1/10 | Get Out is fantastic.

When I first saw the trailer for Get Out, I laughed hard. I thought it looked awful because the trailer was so weird and strangely cut. I was wrong.

Here's what the movie did well.

Get Out is the best movie I've seen so far in 2017. The story follows an African-American man visiting his white girlfriend's house, but there is so much more than just that. The story is incredibly entertaining. The dialogue kept the audience entertained, it was funny, witty, smart, and kept a constant pace. The movie blended horror and comedy perfectly, neither taking center stage. The film has a lot of dark humor which I'm a huge fan of, it worked very well with the setting and tone of the film. The story has twists and turns that are very original and catches the audience off guard. The story has fantastic social commentary, commenting on subtle racism throughout which is very effective. The story keeps the audience on the edge of their seat throughout. When the comedy hits, it hits hard, each joke hit and were well timed. The horror hits hard as well, making the film disturbing and creepy when it needs to be.

The technical things in this movie were amazing. The lighting was consistent and gave the film a dark, stylized, and disturbing vibe. The cinematography was fantastic, each shot giving off a certain feeling which helped move along the story. The music that played in this movie helped with the vibe, fitting whatever scene it was in.

Most everyone who acted in this movie gave a fantastic performance. Daniel Kaluuya, Bradley Whitford, and LilRel Howery particularly giving great performances. Everyone embodied their characters perfectly and put a lot of effort into making sure their characters were believable.

This film was Jordan Peele's directorial debate, if this type of quality holds up in his future films I can see him having a long and successful career in directing. The film is well paced and makes sure to keep the audience on their seat. Peele made sure to get fantastic performances out of his actors and did a great job creating the tone for this movie.

Onto the bad, which there aren't a lot.

There was, out of the whole movie, one shot I didn't like. There was a shot with fire in frame. The fire didn't look real which took me out of the story for a split second.

Caleb Landry Jones's performance was a little over acted. If he acted less like a cartoon character it would have been better but it doesn't effect the movie in a major way.

Overall, Jordan Pelle's Get Out is fantastic,keeping the audience on the edge of their seat when they need to be and made them laugh when the jokes hit. The film is beautiful looking and the story is unique and will surprise many audience members. I highly recommend Get Out if your looking for a quality horror/comedy movie."
72,"3/10 | Nervous about meeting his Caucasian girlfriend's parents, a young African American struggles to work out if everyone is acting strangely around him or if it is just his imagination in this unusual mystery thriller. The film is very deliberately paced with lots of malice foreshadowed but exposition only revealed in tiny chunks along the way. In fact, utterly unsettling as the pre-credits sequence is, it is hard not to wonder whether the film would have been better without it since it is the only scene for quite a while that spells out the horror slant of 'Get Out' beneath its quirky façade. That said, there are enough elements that remain elusive here that the film stays enticing until the end. The final quarter also comes off as a very clever homage to the horror movies of the 1970s, complete with appropriate furniture for the period. What really elevates the film though is its social satire. The racism agenda is a little on-the-nose, but the protagonist's anxiety at being a 'token' African American really clicks, forced to enter into awkward conversations with several houseguests at one point who have no idea how to talk to him without sounding racist. It is actually quite a universal predicament and aside from being a captivating mystery movie, 'Get Out' also pinpoints how strange it can be to interact in an environment when one is a minority, whether it be by race, religion, gender, age or other factors."
73,"1/10 | This movie tried to copy everything off of The Skeleton Key. A complete waste of time watching it. Really don't get what all the hype was about.

74,"5/10 | I have heard that a white person remarked when watching this in a theater, all the black people cheered when ever any white person was killed. This film portrays white people as evil racist schemers, while the blacks are heroic and so innocent. I always try to treat everyone I meet the same, with consideration, but I do not get the same in return. As innocent as this movie portrays black people as such benevolent heroes, the truth is far from what this tries to make you believe. Overall it was very well made, with really great actors, I just felt very uncomfortable while watching this that this is just part of the continuing racial war being fed on both sides. Regardless of the past, which shows that every country (including Africa) has had slavery, we need to really work on moving past this. I believe that black filmmakers are trying to keep awareness of the past alive, even though most people in the USA are not racist, its only a fraction of the most ignorant and hateful that keep this up. But the fact that this movie so blatantly makes whites look evil, only furthers the truth as to who is really the most racist in this country.

75,"8/10 | GET OUT is just that - fuel for the ""liberal"" (nothing liberal about them really) SJW hate machine: all white people in this film are racist scum, all black people are good guys and victims. No good white people, no evil bad people. Apart from this issue we are served a below average horror film that is not scary at all and was simply hyped for political reasons. Avoid this. Except of course if you are a SJW in which case you probably already own this film and no doubt hate everyone who does not love this film.

80,"1/10 | ""Get Out"" is about reality distortion. The film seams to portrait ""dumb"" white people that enslave ""talented"" and ""smart"" black people. If we exchanged the color of the characters in the movie, probably the producers would be in jail right now, for racism. Therefore, the story behind the movie (which is a metaphor) is the opposite of what happened in our history, since we know africans sold their families in exchange for goods.

81,"1/10 | This had to be the worst movie I had ever seen in the last 15 years.

It appears this appealed mostly to the African-American audience in attendance while I was there because every time a Caucasian character was either injured or killed, the whole theatre broke out in cheers and doing the Arsenio Hall arm wave. Totally disgusting and uncalled for.

I have nothing good to say about this movie despite the others here who raved about it. Plot made little sense and I just put this movie in with the cobwebs of movies I never want to see ever again.

Get Out made me want to get out - it was that awful and very racially insensitive.

82,"2/10 | I have never written a review on any movie, EVER. Until tonight. I just finished watching Get Out. I am so very confused and slightly irritated. WHAT did I just watch?! WHY did I just watch it? Where can I get some of whatever you people are smoking? I have watched some bad movies in my day. I worked at blockbuster for 5+ years, I have seen some winners... Anyways, the point is this, I watched this movie because it had so many great reviews! 99% of the time I am in agreement with the ratings scale on IMDB. Today, well, today is a different story. I just watched a ""horror"" movie. NOTHING IS SCARY ABOUT THIS MOVIE GUYS! Unless, of course, we're taking into account how terrible it is. Please, do NOT waste your time! Literally one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. So disappointed.

Obama say he represents the black again and again. Ok he's not president any more but he has deep influence the America and divides the current American society.

It'd have been a good film in one hundred years but it's hurting everyone in the current political environment. The result is every black has a thought every white is murdering them so they have to resist. We have to refuse the movie and vote the republicans and Trump the next time.

I got bored during the movie and started to check out Instagram which was fine because it was just me and my friend there. I did not like the fact that ALL the white people in the movie were bad and racist. Imagine how would people rate this movie if it was the other way? I really cannot get it why it got such good rating? Just because it's calling white people racist? I'm not even white myself but totally found it inappropriate. Such a waste of money...

86,"3/10 | Get Out is a decent horror movie, better than average, but not without its set backs. It absolutely didn't deserve an oscar, let alone for screenplay, but it's not the worst choice in the world at the end of the day. For a debut film this is pretty admirable and could mean a lot for horror movies, black people and the general film industry, but aside from the politics of the film, it really is just an ok horror.

The VVitch and It Follows are much, much better horror films; deserving of much more praise, but because THIS horror film has a discussion about race it gets millions of dollars and awards and praise. Is this a bad thing?

Not really. It's better than giving an award to something like another shat out Blumhouse/James Wan sequel with no talent or effort put into it.

Basically, the best thing about the film is the actors and their performances, especially Daniel Kaluuya, who is as excellent as always.

The worst thing about the film would probably have to be the ""horror"" elements since it's incredibly one- note and unoriginal in this department. Not saying it's bad, but it doesn't do anything the horror genre hasn't seen a bunch of times already.

It's good, not great. (But still kinda cool a horror film won an oscar since the last was in 2000 with The Sixth Sense.)"
87,"3/10 | The movie is so anti-white, that I couldn't even imagine that such movies can be created in 21st century, until I watched it. Yes, the actors play good, but the plot is so primitive and there are so many cliches about white people, that I wanted to vomit. White people are displayed as soulless monsters, there are no positive white characters at all! I'm 100%-sure, that if black and white people switched places in this movie, it would be criticized all over the media

88,"4/10 | I just wasted nearly two hours of my life watching one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen, I had heard great things about it, it sounded like an interesting concept, and to be fair, it does start off very well and draws you in. Young Chris Washington, an amiable fellow who's a professional photographer goes to spend the weekend with his white girlfriend's family - he's nervous, as most young men are when meeting their girl's family and that his girl hasn't disclosed his race to her parents puts him even more on edge. At first blush, her parents are typical upper-middle class professional pseudo-liberals - even without what follows, they're not at all likable - the young woman has a brother who looks like white trash, gets drunk at the family dinner that evening and, in his passive-aggressive way, really wants to kick the crap out of Chris. There's an extended family gathering that weekend - which makes poor Chris even more anxious, but he outwardly calm and unflappable and is a good sport, if only to please his girlfriend.

I won't disclose what happens next - but the story just devolves into abject stupidity. Pointless, in my view, violence and a denouement that is anti-climatic. I couldn't wait for this film to be over - for a film that got off to such an interesting and promising start, I was greatly disappointed.

If the message here is that white people have a desire to continually subjugate Blacks, meh - as a white man, I can't even take umbrage at that because A) I'm not sure that's what Jordan Peele is trying to assert and B) in its execution, it's just plain silly and mindless.

Nota bene - I rented this from Netflix on Blu-Ray - there was a very clear message that if you WANT to see the bonus features, which looked very interesting, you had to OWN the DVD - the Netflix copy was a no-frills, movie only copy - really? Is this something new or Universal being withholding and just plain idiotic. Speaking for myself, I can't recommend this film - it's a cut above a made-for-television feature - it tries, in its way, to bring a ""Rosemary's Baby"" suspense to it and it just fails miserably in that regard - perhaps they were aiming a bit too high."
89,"1/10 | Despite my rating, I don't hate this film. I find it to be an unspecial movie that doesn't know if it's a horror or comedy one. Surprisingly Jordan Peele has some film knowledge, and it shows a couple of times in the film, for example the opening or the hypnosis scenes. Overall this movie is decent on a technical aspect, but what ruins it is the script. Full with plot holes and clichés and nonsense, the movie is just stupid. It tries to be more than what it is introducing social and political commentary. First of all, i'm not american, i'm mexican. And second, I don't care about what happens in the USA. For me, a movie that says that racism is bad and white people are bad, will not have an impact on me. I don't hate white people like a lot of americans, i'm not a SJW, and I don't sympatize with black people (because they are the most racist towards latin americans, believe or not). So, the fact that this movie has this message, doesn't make it good. Letting this aside, we just have another generic horror movie, with stupid jumpscares and stupid characters and bad acting (except Daniel Kaluuya, he does a good job) and a stupid script (we know why this won an Oscar, because is a movie made by black people). If you genuiney like this film, that's ok, good for you. But please, don't go around hating and calling people racist because they don't agree with you."
90,"5/10 | Didn't have a chance to see it in theater, so was psyched that FX was showing it tonight. The hype when it was released was inescapable.

Zero suspense, completely predictable, yes I get it. In the first five minutes. Watch ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" instead. Not a horror movie (which ""Get Out"" claimed to be, though nothing really horrifying about it), but a much more sensitive, intelligent, and interesting study of racial issues.

It was a good watch though and I recommend it if you haven't seen it already, because there's a lot to learn from writing like this. Also to be picky there were a few green screen shots near the end that pestered me, but everything else was pretty good.

95,"1/10 | Basic run-down of the movie.

Black people: GOOD.

White people: BAD.

I'm not racist at all, but this tends to be some kind of theme that's going on in Hollywood nowadays. Especially with the overly leftist way Hollywood has been conducting itself recently (and I lean to the left personally). Very sub-par movies like Moonlight winning Best Picture. This horror movie getting 99% on rotten tomatoes. I feel like everyone is afraid to bash things that are 'safe space' issues now, but I'm not afraid to say this was an alright movie, certainly not awful, but nowhere near Oscar material or warranting a 99% critical review.

I can almost feel the agenda being shoved down my throat on so many movies now."
96,"2/10 | I usually look at my imdb scores quite seriously but this one is at least a full point if not 2 above what it should be. Just because it involves racism, everyone feels the need to rate it so greatly... Nah

103,"9/10 | If Jordan Peele's intention was to contribute to deteriorating race relations in this nation, then he may have succeeded. If nothing else, black men will think twice about heading off to the countyside with their white girlfriends. On the other hand, I can totally relate to the protagonist in this film. I once attended a Christmas party with my friend Albert and I was the only white person there - except for an accountant, an orthodontist, and a cardio-thoracic surgeon. Just kidding, there were no other white people at the party. It was uncomfortable, not intolerable, but I could feel the tension. Racism is real... all races are capable of it. This movie is just silly though.

104,"9/10 | Get Out is by far one of the best movies of the year! You have to watch this at least twice to notice everything you might miss the first time. I've seen it countless times and each time I discover something different about the story, it's so brilliantly done that every viewing is a lesson and an experience. The messages and the parallels with real life are just chilling. This movie should be taught in schools to be honest.

106,"1/10 | I loved this film. Nine reasons this film deserves a ""9"" review

1) The plethora of corny, not-so-veiled, race references. 2) Action ending with plenty of well-deserved dying and gore. 3) Actress Betty Gabriel playing the role of Georgina. 4) Creepy silent Bingo scene. 5) Rosemary's Baby meets Deliverance vibe. 6) Fantastic hypnosis special effects. 7) No-holds-barred Black, humor and profanity lines. 8) Impressive directorial debut by Jordan Peele. 9) Finally,what a blast of ironic magnificence to have the Black man pick cotton (from the chair arms) to save his life.

p.s. Took away one star for the jarring music/scene shift in the opening credits. Cut from the tracking woods shot directly to the apartment establishing shot next time.

107,"1/10 | I honestly cannot see why people are praising this film as some sort of masterpiece, the ""horror"" that it boasts can only be compared to that of a 2006 YouTube Poop video, it's story contains MASSIVE continuity errors and the acting is complete and utter garbage. If you are thinking of watching this film and are in your right mind then I plead you to simply ignore it and let it die out.

110,"9/10 | This movie surprised me, I thought it was going to include a typical deep south racist vibe, something along the lines of his girl friend lowering him in to the WASPy culture to find out there is some sort of long bloodline of connectivity between the two families that traces its way back to the colonial days. this is not what it is at all. With some comedic relief from LilRel Howery as ""Chris's"" TSA conspiracy theorist friend, spouting off about racist sex slave owners. And some very tense scenes making you feel uncomfortable in your own living room with the awkwardness between neighbors in the film. The feelings presented in the movie were very well empathized with the viewer throughout the film. No wonder its oscar nominated it was extremely well done.

""Get out"" was worth the watch if you think you know what its about, think again and enjoy the flick

This is my first real review i hope to leave more and get better at them"
111,"9/10 | I've seen this movie about 10 times, and every time I've seen it again I can grasp further details! This is an authentic horror movie like I've not seen in many years!! The last thing I've caught up is a poster with the legend ""Death Cheetah vs Matter"" which by searching the internet, I've found that is related to something about white supremacy and life extension by changing the body or so! I'm still looking for another eastern eggs around!

112,"9/10 | What a great movie this is! It really gets under your skin in a good kind of way.. Unsuspecting turns which makes your mind go in multiple directions - all wrong. Brilliant acting & cast and great music. It is no horror movie, maybe this label scares people off. Yeah it has some horror aspects in it, but it is more like a high level psychological thriller. The story is straightforward, but well connected. Near the end, everything comes together. No loose ends. Definitely one of the better movies I've seen in this genre over the last couple of years. Go see it!

113,"9/10 | Peele's debut Get Out is a far cry from his stand up and Key and Peele days, channeling the goriness, witty plot hints, and over the top evil from classic horror flicks of the 80s. The modern racial twist is the cherry on top, being built up by incredible acting performances and music throughout.

114,"9/10 | The level at which the video has subliminal messages is impressive. Really like how the director placed underlining messages in the dialogue. I am a horror fanatic and this definitely floated my boat.

And great plus to this movie was also the casting. Choosing some ""grass root"" characters..(and I put them in quotes because I had not really heard about them till the movie) was really helpful in making us not get distracted by a start studded cast. Its definitely one to look out for and you will need to watch it at least more than once to full appreciate the movie and its depth.

It's right up there with my best movies.

115,"9/10 | The plot is very well written and away from Clichés, though it has some inspirations and the house in the movie is very familiar. Characters are not extremely stupid like in most of the horror movies, and this makes the movie enjoyable as you find a little bit reasoning. The third part I liked was that the movie scares without gruesome or bloody images, and there are not any jump scares. The movie actually scares the audience with thought and getting inside of the mind. Throughout the movie, a mysterious ambiance follows, and this makes the movie fluent. Lastly, cinematography is really good. With this good cinematography, acting and fiction are well reflected toward audience. Otherwise, the movie would be wasted. Overall, I liked the movie very much as a rare type of horror movies.

I'd hesitate to say that this is a horror movie, however, it has horror elements but it doesn't properly belong to this genre. but I don't want to get into conceptual discussion.

As for the scenario it was wonderful, I was very impressed by the functionality of the comedy in a very strange atmosphere.

120,"6/10 | My worst fear when I heard about this movie was that it would be filled with liberal/black racism against white people.Well,it wasn't .It somewhat exaggerated the racism on both sides,but not hatefully,making it quite even and laughable rather than maddening and provocative. The only thing I disagree with is that the whole ''black paranoia'' (thinking all the white people are out to get them) thing turned out to be ''helpful'' which is certainly not a thing in reality.Well,we all knew the setting of the movie and it does fit *this movie specifically*.I just hope that people don't take it the wrong way and accept it as a global fact.

Conclusion: a great watch with interesting twists. Might've been better without the whole race controversy,which was actually handled exceptionally well.(and I guess it did boost it's popularity and added a decent social message,as long as you don't get triggered easily)

123,"1/10 | Am I the only liberal intellectual that hated this movie? It seems Hollywood and the critics supported it only because the director was a connected minority and they were scared to tell anyone how bad it was out of fear of retaliation or being shunned by certain communities or social circles. Much like an ""artist"" that draws a circle and tries to pass it off as brilliant modern art after giving it a two hour explanation of how it represents the internal struggle between good and evil, it was all hype without any substance. It was not clever, witty or enlightened. Rather, it was just a bunch of mindless clichés lumped together trying to pass for social commentary. I would have expected more from a first year film student. I found it rather painful to sit through, and insulting to all minorities and anyone that paid to see this movie. The emperor has no clothes. None. Zilch. Nada. It fails miserably in terms of both comedy and horror, as it did neither well. The only interesting thing about this film is all of the people that pretended to like it. Your gut was right, you should have walked out and saved a few brain cells. The title of this movie is a warning to all theater goers. GET OUT now while you still have time to salvage your day."
124,"1/10 | In the movie white people go out of their way to try to show the black main character how ""unracist"" they are by constantly saying things like ""I would have voted for Obama a 3rd time if I could, best president ever"". This in a nutshell is why this movie is universally well received by critics. If a movie has racial themes white critics go out of their way to say how amazing it is, and sometimes the movie is actually amazing, but here it's nothing more than white guilt. The movie is so lacking is subtlety when it comes to it's race themes that it induces eye rolling, and it depicts a society so uncomfortable with black people that its a wonder they can even co-exist. It's as if the movie has an agenda that it has to constantly point out. The premise is too idiotic for even a horror movie, and I could forgive these things easily if it were the least bit scary, tense or funny. If these critics reviews are genuine and not a self conscious reflection of their views on race than I fear that society has become dumbed down to the point where Stephenie Meyer is considered Shakespeare and Get Out is considered To Kill A Mockingbird."

129,"9/10 | I won't describe the premise, because it's a surprise, so how can I tell you how original this movie is? Consider how many times hypnotism has been portrayed on film. Well, you've never seen hypnotism portrayed as it is here. Everything about this movie is refreshing.

All you really need to know is that, during the climax, the audience of the packed theater applauded, and a minute later they all laughed. But then, 5 minutes later they applauded AGAIN, and a minute later laughed AGAIN. Such is the impact this gem of a film had in that showing.

Thrillers often employ humor, but it's usually not funny and it's used in inappropriate places. Here the humor is timed perfectly with the thrills so they don't interfere with each other, and it isn't used too often, but when this film is funny it's really funny.

The cast has no major stars, and hardly any recognizable faces, yet the director got Oscar worthy performances out of several of them."

132,"9/10 | It's very refreshing to enjoy a masterpiece, obviously. This is an art piece. Just because horror and comedy don't get labelled as art very often doesn't mean it isn't possible. Why? The movie doesn't care what you have to say about it, it just wants to be itself, get its message through, which it does in brilliant fashion. So many layers in this movie will inspire you to reflect on people and society from a fresh perspective. The leads' performance and character development is the kingpin holding it all together. Here you get a brilliantly subtle portrayal of a well fleshed out main character. I'm not a fan of Key & Peele so I resisted watching the flick out of expectation that the humour would turn me off. So glad I gave in and watched it as this film in fact presents a well balanced, thoughtful and expertly wielded theme; one which most are too fearful to touch with a ten foot pole. It must be tough to create a clear, focused vision with topics that are so controversial, but clearly there is much more to Peele than the lighthearted comedian, for here he has have crafted and directed a bold, mature and most of all, important piece of cinema. All the while the horror is still good horror and the humour is still good humour. Smart. Very very smart."

134,"9/10 | I just recently rewatched this movie and I'm happy I did, because there are so many details I didn't realize during my first watch, but I did realize during the second time, which made it even more fun to watch and a better film overall.

GET OUT is a horror-satire that discusses the issue of racism (at least certain aspects of it), but it does it in a way that is not heavy-handed or preachy. I like the fact that it makes fun of how white people tend to relate to black people, but also how black people tend to relate to white people and even to each other. At the same time it has some genuine moments that show the difficulties black people can have in a white-majority environment. Nowadays people can be labeled a racist even for ridiculous reasons (especially in the U.S.) which is a very unhealthy tendency in society. And if that's something that bothers you as well, let me assure you, GET OUT is not a film of that spirit, its goal is not to make white people feel guilty. This movie is smart, funny, but it also has heart, and is honest about the topic.

Acting, directing, writing and cinematography are great across the board. The two best performances, in my opinion, are that of Daniel Kaluuya, who plays the main character and Lakeith Stanfield who plays a smaller role, but is fantastic in that.

GET OUT is thrilling, creepy, funny, sometimes over-the-top, and even though it was released back in January, for me (as of September 4, 2017) it is still the best movie of the year.

9/10"
135,"9/10 | The secret is out. The world now knows that Jordan Peele is not only known for fame in the comedic realm, but also for debuting a very effective thriller. ""Get Out"" is ultimately effective due to its intriguing premise and crowd pleasing mentality. Comic relief in horror usually falls flat for me, and confuses the tone of the film. Here, it's used very skillfully, and the laugh/thrill mixture is very successful. This directorial debut is a win that is delivered from a very unexpected mind. #getout

137,"9/10 | Discrimination, in all its possible variables, is a matter of which it's possible to get very far both in extension and intellection, an issue that has touched various media in terms of attacking this puppet of such evil purposes. Basing on a sad-popular behavior such as racism in the United States of today, filmmaker Jordan Peele—who gained status by TV shows of a comic nature that with the accustomed dubious quality achieved American transcendence—presents a sour, fiery and impetuous social satire brimming with black humor with delicious psychological thriller hint that arrives in order to impact strong on a certain well-off sector thanks to a reflective tale of the big little lies that we tell each other in such a clever, effective and commercial way that might well gets it a list of meritorious titles as ""cult film"" or ""the best suspense movie of the year"" and maybe, a round of accolades for its splendid components, identical in quality, different in appearance.

Peele's feature film converges, in not few vertices, with the laudable allegorical representation (""The Invitation"", 2015) by American filmmaker Karyn Kusama, highlighting as the main concomitant the essence of the true thriller: increasing discomfort and vulnerability sown in order to audience does not feel secure with what happens on the screen, which provokes in this incessant birth of perceptions toward the loaded questions posed by the story. A genre equivalent to a perverse roulette, in which in the slightest moment of carelessness, a rush of revolutions can shake your safety from head to toe. Such concordance adorned with an acute social criticism, substantial of the authentic films inaugurated by Mr. Hitchcock, in which are exhibited the poorest actions that we can come to commit. We're the black and white dots.

While it builds outstanding psychological game with detailedness, Peele, deserving of double mention acting as scriptwriter and director, conjures up ordinary components and other unusual that can be abridged in three major fields: the first one, of course, is the narrative, although, beyond wise skill of developing the subliminal core idea, it's the successful combination and harmonization between two discordant genres as horror and comedy, an impressive achievement especially in the decadent film period in which we are in. While comedy is based on the supporting comic relief gags (contradictory and stereotypical a black man) and the irony of the situations, it's fascinating as horror doesn't require scary monsters or spooky entities to fulfill its objective (although there are), here, terror springs up from dread and the veiled significance of the words, from confrontation with the harsh reality. The second one is plausible constituents at a technical level, namely, its mise-en-scène, soundtrack, cinematography, and photography that unite the vertiginous final act with the hesitant first act using, as usual in Jason Blum's company, precise elements that facilitate and enrich the following of the story. It's prodigious in the composition of its images, having in its power a vacation home encircled by a dry forest is not a break, on the contrary, it's sensational as they create beauty, usually in confined spaces, with what they have. With certainty, the film has conceived one of the most beautiful shots in horror film history, an oneiric picture where Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) jolts awake after a cyclic hypnosis in a pale leather sofa, with the sound effect from an old TV as the only company, his face—tremendously photographic—raises an analogy through the melodramatic tears in his exorbitant eyes, a frame that will last in the memory of any modern cinephile. There are also sparkling scenes, which reach horns of the moon in its exciting third act, highlighting vigorously camera focus in the third major factor: the overwhelming and heterogeneous performances. Kaluuya's role radiates power and strength, he's sensitive and unprotected when he needed, aggressive and lethal when everything is a disaster. The alienation of the Armitage family is dosed between the competent actors, from which stand out Allison Williams (with a twisted plot worthy of Shyamalan) and her brother in the fiction, interpreted by Caleb Landry Jones. Exclusive attention requests scene stealer Betty Gabriel, who plays a couple of shocking scenes, with dimensions of complexity and interpretative depth typical of an acting matron. Be careful because this lady and Kaluuya will present great surprises.

Conscious of its game, Peele's motion picture is a deliberate subversion, offered by the hand of cinema, which cries out for the eradication of injustices perpetuated by the social and political sects of the Trump era. It also breaks supposed barriers between genres and ideas and overflows creativity and power by creating situations as exciting as cartoon-like, as intelligent as reflexive; A satire that wasn't requested, perhaps out of fear, but in the end, it came with a relentless purpose. It achieves what many feature films don't: surprise and affect."
138,9/10 | 
139,"9/10 | As you will see from the film trailer, meeting the parents and their neighbours, etc... can be a very daunting task. Especially when you feel you may have your doubts about them liking you. So when Chris meets his girlfriends parents he finds them to be nice, well actually too nice. In fact he becomes concerned there is something a little too nice and a little too weird. Worth watching, it isn't scary although there are a few things that would make it unsuitable for younger viewers.

141,"9/10 | Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut and it's about a young black man whose white girlfriend takes him to meet her parents. There is a lot racism going on and he starts getting more and more paranoid.

I really can't describe the plot of this movie very well without spoiling too much and that's because of the one problem I have with this movie:awkward pacing. It's a bit of a slow-burn until the very end and then everything is resolved very quickly. It's still well-done and intense, yes, but the pacing makes the whole thing feel a bit off. There is also a comic relief character that was given way too much to do. He wasn't annoying, he was actually pretty funny, but his constant appearing gave us some way too sudden tonal shifts. Now while I'm saying all this, it probably sounds like I didn't like the movie, but I really did. I didn't think it was perfect, but it was an interesting ride.

The premise itself is pretty smart, I just felt that more could be done with more psychological parts of the movie. Even though the plot structure isn't the best, the dialogues are very well written and backed up by very strong performances. Main character is well developed and you really care about him, which makes the whole situation even more intense. Through the first two acts, not much really happens, but you can't help but feel that sense of dread. Then things go down. Actually, it has a similar structure to The Wicker Man, just with a less disturbing ending.

This movie has its flaws, but that didn't stop me from enjoying it because it won me over with an intense atmosphere and nail- biting climax."
142,"8/10 | Get Out is a fantastic film, and a hit for audiences around the world. The acting is great, the story is great, the pacing is fantastic, and the movie looks fantastic. There really isn't much to complain when it comes to Jordan Peele's first film. So to go with all of my praise, I decided to give Get Out a ""Very Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. I can't wait to see what will come next.. possibly a film called Come In? Who knows?

145,"9/10 | Film fans might avoid the movie ""Get Out"" because it looks like another drama about a black man, a white woman, and the way they are treated in the inter racially unfriendly deep south. However they will quickly discover that director Jordan Peele has twisted this theme of racial ethnicity into a bizarre and intense psychological thriller. The story revolves around Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) a young black photographer who is dragged by his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to her parent's traditional gathering of wealthy white family and friends. Chris is well aware of the hostility he might encounter from the white folks in Alabama but he isn't prepared for the unnatural behaviour of the black people he encounters, especially the gardener (Marcus Henderson) and the maid (Betty Gabriel) whom Rose ironically insists are part of the Armitage family. Rose's father, Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) walks Chris through the family history and discloses some interesting facts Rose's grandfather while his wife Missy (Catherine Keener) corrals Chris into a discussion about hypnosis and her ability to cure people of their disgusting smoking habit all the while stirring a cup of tea with her spoon. Everything seems benign in the Armitage family until Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones) reveals his true racial prejudice although Missy quickly puts him back in line. The next day, Chis is introduced to several guests attending the gathering who share their admiration for particular traits of black race; the physical strength, the athletic ability, and the fashionable appeal. But when he notices the one black guest resembles an old acquaintance named Dre (Lakeith Stanfield) who mysteriously disappeared from the neighbourhood several years ago, Chris calls his New York friend Rod (LilRel Howery) who investigates the matter and eventually comes to rescue him from this horrible nightmare. ""Get Out"" will certainly prove to be one of the great, psychological thrillers and deserves its high IMDb rating."
146,"9/10 | Notice it rates highly amongst movie goers,yet anyone who fears its "" reverse racist "" scores it 1 or 2? So it's better than you'd expect. Take away the hate and it's closer to 8.5. It deals with old school racism ( yes ) but not in the way most expect. It's not horror ( apart from being trapped , is horror ) social dialogue aside it's a great thriller, keeps clues coming with enough humour to keep it fairly light. Feel weird about being hypnotized and clucking like a duck for the rest of your life? This is the movie for you. Enjoy.

151,"9/10 | Debuting director Jordan Peele knows how to handle his budget. Universal Pictures, who were smart enough to pick up the movie for distribution, can be quite pleased with the turnout: with $4.5 million in production budget, the movie has already returned $204,3 million (and it's still counting) at the box office worldwide. One thing is for sure: director Peele knows how to balance between the swamp of horror clichés and a sketchy, almost over-the-top humour (reminding to some extent of Edgar Wright), but he also gives his comedy horror another dimension by playing with the conventions of whites-and-blacks relations.

152,"4/10 | Rose Armitage is taking her boyfriend, Chris Washington, to meet her parents for the first time. He's a bit uneasy about how they'll treat him, as they're white and he's black. However, her parents turn out to be unfazed and everything seems to be going fine. Chris then starts to notice some weird behavioral traits with the black staff at the house. The Armitages then throw a huge party and Chris ends up in some awkward conversations with the guests. He initially just puts it down to the racial difference, but then the guests', and Armitages', motives start to appear more sinister. Chris decides it is time to get out...

Great directorial debut from Jordan Peele, who also wrote the script. Peele was one half of the hilarious comedy duo Key and Peele, so you would be excused for thinking that his first movie would be a comedy. Get Out is not a comedy. It starts as a social commentary and ends as a horror-thriller.

In both respects it is great, though I preferred the social drama aspect more. Some very clever observations regarding race relations in the first half of the movie, and I imagine a fairly accurate depiction of the African-American experience. As a horror-thriller the build up and plot development is very good but the ending felt a bit too easy and rushed. The conclusion is also not very profound, which is a bit disappointing after all the social observations that came before.

This said, the ending would be the only weak spot, and it only appears weak because the rest of the movie was so good.

Peele does throw in some comedy moments, via the character of Rod Williams, and these are great.

Solid performances all round. Daniel Kaluuya, as Chris, is probably the best of lot. LilRel Howery, as Rod Williams, almost steals the show though.

Great movie."
153,"5/10 | I wanted to see a horror film and I picked up this one. Though it is not horror in my opinion, I am not disappointed, on the contrary, this was really interesting film.

I can not really comment on all racial things concerning this film as I come from place where there are no such differences in race but I do understand what the film wanted to say in that matter.

The whole film from the moment the couple enters the house feels like a modern episode of Twilight Zone. The atmosphere, the fake/forces smiles of the maid, the unusual behaviour of the gardener, the hypnosis scenes...

Must say that the main couple did a great job! They were really convincing in their roles. Parents a bit less or maybe it is just the way their roles were supposed to. Brother was crazily spooky during the dinner and after...

The time of my life song was lol while she was picking up the next victim.

All in all, this is really an entertaining film. Full of surprises, twists are unexpected. You feel all along that something is not right, but you can never guess really what is going on.

157,"5/10 | Lets start by saying, this is pretty much the best movie I have seen this year. The story is great, easy to get into it and unsettling.

Starting with the basic. The acting was top notch. The girl kind of fall flat at the end but other than that, great all around. Main and support and even the one liner are very good.

The setting and the camera work was great yet again. Only one thing that to me made no sense but it is minor. The rest was perfect in my opinion.

The story was fun for everyone. If you are a black person, you will see an ""exaggerated"" version of things that might happen. If you are not, the movie does a great job in putting you in his shoes. Back to the story, t starts slow but not boring and ramps up fast. It keeps you guessing. To be honest, I was expecting something very different as a plot twist but the way they went works. I found one hole in the story I can't explain but I am guessing it is explain in the extended or deleted scenes. There is no jump scare, no cheap gimmick, only a good story that keeps you in suspense.

I don't know how to explain it with no spoiler but YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS! If horror is not your type of movie, this is still a great movie for you. It is more of a thriller movie with a horror story.

Worth it!"
158,"5/10 | Spoiler Alerts!!!! Spoiler Alerts!!!! Spoiler Alerts!!!! READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT RUINED FOR YOU.

I heard a lot about this film and that it was an excellent horror movie with a relevant social message. I looked eagerly forward to seeing it and now that I have; I can honestly say that I am very disappointed with the film. After 20 minutes I was going to turn it off but I kept hanging on to see ""when"" and ""if"" anything interesting would happen and what the fuss was all about. It took a long time for anything of ""note to happen"" (most of the plot action takes place in the last 15 or 20 frenzied minutes).

More Spoiler Alerts!!!! Spoiler Alerts!!!! Spoiler Alerts!!!! READ NO FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT RUINED FOR YOU.

If anyone has ever seen the classic Universal Studios 1948 horror comedy Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein then you'll know the plot for ""Get Out"" (coincidentally released by Universal Studios) borrowed liberally, (i.e. was ripped off from that A&C movie). This time, instead of Dracula wanting to transplant Costello's simple mind (brain) into the Frankenstein monster so the monster will be malleable and compliant; we have rich, old, white folks wanting to have their brains transplanted into young, healthy, black people's bodies with stronger bodies so the white folks can live longer and be healthier. I guess it's some kind of twisted, sicko old, rich, white person's idea of the fountain of youth or fantasy utopia? (Duh!) Go figure. The idea makes you wonder what the families of the old, rich, white people do about their elderly family member's death certificates and how they cover up the missing old, rich, white family members in the outside world. No one seems to ever miss them or question the ""new"" black family members.

Get out clocks in at a slowly paced one hour and 45 minutes but if you watch the first 15 minutes and skip to the last 20 frenzied minutes (where all the IMPROBABLE action takes place and I mean VERY IMPROBABLE); you'll save yourself 1 hour and 10 minutes of snooze time. Virtually nothing happens for that long stretch in between.

ONE MORE SPOILER ALERT: The ending you can drive a MACK truck through the improbable happenings and ridiculous overkill. It would be one hell of a messy situation to clean up and walk away from.

The biggest peeve I have is the guy's ""loving, white girl friend"", i.e. kidnapper who lures young, black people to her parents home in secluded upstate NY. She actually leaves the light on in her closet with a shoe box (lid ajar) for the suspicious black boyfriend to find. It's smack dab in the middle of the closet floor, light shining on it with nothing else around! The contents - oh just many photos of his girl friend with every black boyfriend and one girl friend she has lured to her parent's home. There must be at least 10 to 15 of those victims each pictured lovingly with her. A very busy family industry they've got going there. Why would she do that? Answer: As a plot device to hammer it home to the boyfriend/victim and to the viewing audience. In case you couldn't figure out what was happening already.

In the end, ""Get Out"" is an inferior horror movie that would have made a poor 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone way back in the day.

Social message??? I don't think so, unless you want to read one into it.

More likely it exploits the racial divide in some parts of society to garner ticket sales for the studio.

In the end like so many other poor horror movies, ""Get Out"" seems like the idea one gets from a crazy mixed up nightmare after eating too much greasy pizza late at night.

Recommendation: Skip ""Get Out"" --- pardon the pun, it is a ""no brainer""- ha ha ha."
159,"1/10 | I enjoyed most of the film, the suspense / thriller / mystery side of it.. until it came to the part when I realize it is a copy of another film, which is also a copy of another film. Don't get me wrong I enjoy watching remakes from the same novel but surely it has to end somewhere. The actors were semi ok, the main actor was terrible. (he wasn't sure where to look most of the time)

An alright mystery thriller for all ages though. I'd give it 6/10 if I hadn't seen the same plot used so many times already

161,"8/10 | When you are wondering whether a movie is ""social satire, allegory, metaphor"" or simply outright racist, all you have to do is reverse the race of the characters. If you made a similar movie where the race of the characters were reversed, there would be rioting outside the theaters. Most of the critics, were too chickensh... to state the obvious, but plenty of individual reviewers had the guts to call this movie what it is, an outright racist, hate-filled movie, in the wrapper of a (very mediocre) horror movie, with a bit of comic relief sprinkled on top. I believe one individual reviewer said he was mortified to watch this in a theater with a black audience, hearing what the audience was yelling in the end. As a horror movie it is full of cliches, predictable to the last moment. Just consider how easily the protagonist escapes in the end. It's not a horror, but a horrible movie.

162,"8/10 | Jordan Peele's strong directorial debut got well deserved Oscar attention, as it's unique, intelligent, and often times subtle storytelling made for a well layered, suspenseful film experience.

It is hard to say one actor out of the supporting roles stuck out as they all performed so well, but Daniel Kaluuya in the lead role as Chris was superb. His usage of facial expression and body language played so well to his character, and in a movie with plenty of good qualities about it he shines.

Jordan Peele also uses a lot of subtle imagery that contributes well to the themes and tone of his story, which is notably impressive especially for a first time director and make for rewarding second, third and maybe even more repeat viewings.

This movie is not without faults however, as there is a handful of times where characters inexplicably act strange seemingly just for the audience, and like most horror movies coming out recently it has it's pointless, shrill music stabs to emphasize a silly jump scare.

Despite it's faults, I would still highly recommend this one to anyone looking for an intriguing story."
163,"9/10 | I was unsure about this movie before watching it, I was intrigued by the trailer but was worried that, like many other movies of this style, there would be an inevitable 'twist' that would probably ruin it... I'm so glad I watching it.

It starts off as any traditional movie of its type, with small odd things happening, it leads you into making assumptions and gives you clues as to what might be going on and eventually the big reveal fills in all the blanks, it has a satisfying ending with no stupid twist.

I was half expecting an 'it was all a dream' or a 'walking up to reveal the escape was a dream' ending, I'm so glad the didn't do that.

165,"9/10 | Get Out is easily the best movie of 2017, managing to get the highly coveted 99% on Rotten Tomatoes. Once I finally decided to watch the movie, it was easy to see why.

The basic idea behind the plot is this man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has decided to go spend the weekend with his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) and her parents, in an isolated home in Alabama. But, as the weekend progresses (and without revealing too much of the plot), Chris begins to discover something truly sinister.

Jordan Peele, the director and writer, crafts this horror film so delicately, being sure to reveal things slowly and carefully as the film progresses. The plot is simply so original, unique and ingenious, and credit is due to Jordan Peele for all his decisions. He has us viewers believing one thing for the majority of the film, only to dash that aside for a far more sinister truth. This horror movie uses so many common horror tropes, and yet it expertly embraces and twists them into what truly is a masterpiece.

The film also centres around racism, primarily the more subtle, liberal type that has arisen in society in modern times. Jordan Peele intertwines this message of racism so delicately throughout the film, and even though it's a horror movie there's plenty of poignant commentary of the state of racism today.

Personally what I loved about the movie was the pacing, which allowed subtle hints to be sprinkled throughout the movie before the dramatic, sinister reveal. I also loved Kaluuya's acting; it was so raw and believable, and it really had you convinced of the true horror of what was going on throughout the film. Every second of the film we see his character responding and coming to terms with everything going on around him; it's genius.

There were a few things that I didn't love about the film, but they're mostly plot related and I don't want to give spoilers. In my opinion it's not the ""perfect"" movie, but it's so close the difference is honestly negligible. It's especially remarkable given that Jordan Peele is a first time director. Everything about this film - the writing, the acting, the pacing - is so clever, and there is praise due to everyone who worked on this movie. It really does prove that the world of Hollywood still has plenty more ideas to explore yet."
166,1/10 | 
167,"9/10 | Once in a while a movie comes along that takes a genre by the scruff of the neck and vigorously shakes it into a new shape.

This is so with Get Out, a horror movie (so the marketing blurb says) that lobs a few horror tropes into a lean and mean 104 minute thriller. But it is really a social observation on the insidiousness of racism. It comes out the other end as a unique movie offering.

It borrows from Pacific Heights, Psycho, Michael Haneke's astonishing Party Games and sub-horror-porn like Saw without ever being any of them.

Without resorting to spoilers its one gigantic twist from start to finish that realises the fears of a young black American guy on a trip to the country to meet his wealthy WASP girlfriend's family on a celebration weekend. Every sentence uttered by every character becomes a retrospective clue as to what the outcome will be.

Given it's described as a 'horror' you can expect a deal of nasty stuff in a climactic ending. What director and screenwriter Jordan Peele (amazingly a debut outing) most cleverly does is apply Hitchcockian tension so that 89 minutes of tension are realised in a mere 15 minutes of terror in such a way that the nasty bits don't (as so often is the case) outstay their welcome.

Superb performances all round from the five principal actors, but especially boyfriend and girlfriend Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams (Girls).

It's should be no surprise that this has been both BAFTA and Golden Globes nominated, but it is because this genre rarely reaches this level of critical acclaim.

It'll get Oscar nods too."
168,"10/10 | I watched the movie last night at cinema. As an idea, was innovated and after I saw 8.2/10 I thought myself ""why not""? Didn't even worth the 3.75 euros spent for a ticket. As a comedy was pretty cool, but as a horror movie SUCKS. Best part was LilRel Howery's part. As for bonus: 20 year-old guy, sitting next to me was scared and had his eyes closed!!! Nice audience as it goes for rating movies..

173,"5/10 | When you think of the Oscars, you think of big, sweepy dramas like Saving Private Ryan, or big, extravagant musicals like Chicago, but when was the last time you thought of a Horror movie for Best Picture? If you can't remember any, it's because horror movies rarely made the cut, much less win the Best Picture award. Past nominees from this genre includes The Exorcist, Jaws, Sixth Sense, Black Swan, The Silence of the Lambs (the only winner so far), and now we have a new addition to this prestigious list: Get Out.

Get Out tells the story of Chris who's whisked away for the weekend by his girlfriend so he can meet her parents. His nerves are understandable because aside from the possible awkward and tense first meeting, factoring in their interracial relationship, he doesn't just worry if they'll like him for who he is but also for what he is, an African-American. The feeling of uneasiness never escaped him as later his nervousness is converted to fear for his life when things start to unravel as to what the true purpose of the trip was for.

I browsed the reception of the movie and it's praises all around and is one of the most buzzed about nominee this year. Of it's four nominations (Picture, Actor, Director, Screenplay), I would have to agree most with the Best Actor nod for Daniel Kaluuya who I remember and loved from one of my favorite Black Mirror episodes: '15 Million Merits', and just yesterday hated (in a good way) as W'Kabi in Black Panther. While he won't probably win (there wasn't enough that can be done with the role compared to Timothee Chalamet's Elio or Gary Oldman's Churchill), those scenes were he cries on point just takes your breath away. As for the rest of the nominations, it might just be me but I don't get the extreme love for it, which includes a 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I get that it's breaking barriers, the symbolism (some of which I got only after reading up on the movie) but to me it's just another horror movie. Maybe I've seen too much of Blumhouse Production movies such as all Purge installments, Insidious, Sinister and Paranormal Activity that's why I'm lumping it with the rest of them. It might win due to it's popularity but if we're talking overall production, it doesn't hold a spoon (pun intended for those who've seen it) at least against CMBYN and Darkest Hour."

183,"10/10 | This film is so much more than your standard horror movie. If anything, it's much more a suspense movie with a devious twist. The plot is simple enough at first, girlfriend brings boyfriend to her place for uncomfortable meeting with her family. Sure, basic enough. But Jordan Peele has constructed a film that is anything but basic.

The interracial couple in and of itself can make people uncomfortable, and the ingratiating of a white family to the daughter's black boyfriend can also be its own thing easily. What Peele does is merge those two, and makes every seemingly accepting scene cringe-worthy no matter what race you may be. If you're white, the white people are embarrassing you. If you're black, you're feeling the discomfort of being in a place like this, and wondering if there isn't something underneath the apparent good words.

In that way, Peele encapsulates our society. White people invoking Barack Obama's name as though it gives them credibility among black people, for instance. Through each scene, you begin to wait for the other shoe to drop, and wonder what exactly it means when it happens.

When it does, the film brings the slow boil to a raging inferno, and the connections make themselves in a way that creates great suspense and terror until it all reaches its inevitable crescendo. Peele has, as such, built a perfectly frightening movie, and with its deep societal roots, it is intelligent, and its timeliness ensures its excellence and a historical place.

The acting is stupendous, and the twists are crazy good. The comic relief that Rod provides as a goofy TSA agent is a great counterbalance that not only taps into the comic genius that Peele is, but provides the viewer a momentary respite from the immediacy of Chris's plight.

10/10. See this movie and see it often."
184,"10/10 | Excellent horror movie. It has many spoofs, non-sense & unlikely events, however, the story line is so original and characters are so freaky that it's overshadowed. Jordan Peele surprised everybody with this master piece mix of horror and black comedy, yet raising the racism issue to a total uncharted territory. Outstanding performances by Kaluuya and Williams, special recognition to Betty Gabriel.

186,"9/10 | I won't even bother telling you the premise. I'm sure you know it. What I will say is that this has extremely tight writing. The plot twists hold up. I can't think of a single plot hole, and I'm one of those people who obsessively tears apart films looking for those (I don't usually have to even try).

I have a mixed race family, and I say it's extremely relevant, politically, racially, in today's world. It's not an anti-white film, it's not calling all white people racist, or anyone racist, it's just probably using some dialog the writer/director has probably heard a million times in conversations with white people in high society.

It's not a horror movie as it's listed on IMDb and by most viewers. It has some horror elements, but it's really a suspense movie, and it's a very good one because for the first half of the movie or more, you have a growing sense of dread, and you have no idea why. To top it off, it has some very funny parts, but they don't ruin the suspense because the funny man is on the other end of a phone, the protagonist's only link to the outside world, as it were, and so it is compartmentalized and doesn't diminish the very real threat he is facing."
187,"2/10 | I am by no means a professional troll, here to say that my opinion is relevant. However, this movie was FANTASTIC, but again, that is just my 2 cents. For a debut in directing, especially when it's Jordan Peele, I was awestruck. Not for my lack in trust in his ability, but this was a horror/thriller, and I have known his work for always being something more along the lines of side splitting hilarity. I heard he directed this film, often times, doing his impressions of President Obama (how I miss thee) and his other well known impressions. I also hear that Jordan took notes from the late and great George A. Romero, in creating the story around a black man as the protagonist, which really how often do we see that? Always refreshing to see a new perspective in an old genre. If you really want to see a new look unto ""meeting the family"" of your significant other, watch this movie. Especially if you are wasting your precious times reading reviews like mine, and others. Take the 90 mins or so and sit back. The soundtrack also worth listening. I give it a 10 out of 10. This is nothing like Keanu, but it's still a great movie. Kukdos, Mr. Jordan Peele, I was already a fan, but now, I am much cooler. XO"

190,"8/10 | This is no perfect movie, but it shouldn't be criticized strictly for racism. The fact is that there exists a group of evil people that have developed a way to use kidnapped victims for scientific purposes. Their motivations are really quite personal and self serving. But unless you are willing to accept that this can be done, then it's no movie. Much science fiction is based on things that are impossible. The bad guys seem to be interested in picking on black people for some reason. But the plot says they do. Peele uses black humor (excuse the term but I mean it in the general sense) and manages to get some of his own experiences to tell a story. I thought it was unique, interesting, and entertaining.

191,"4/10 | ""A mind is a terrible thing to waste."" Of course we have all heard this one and brushed it off as just another whimsical, inconsequential, cliche tossed around in the maze of social interaction, but there is whole new depth brought to this phrase by Jordan Peele's independent Horror film ""Get out"" We are met in the film by Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) discussing with his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams); the plans for the weekend stay at his girlfriend's family estate. Immediately the issue of race is involved when Chris asks ""Do they know I'm black?"", which is met with the reassurance of Rose that this won't be an issue. When at the estate, there is nothing intrinsically wrong, but at the same time everything has an odd sense to it. Our nerves are settled with the line ""I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could"", delivered by Rose's father, but our intention is immediately recaptured by the oddity of the groundskeeper trimming the grass with a old school rotary lawn mower. This is completely intentional, and complete genius by Peele, as no other emphasis is put on that mower, but it all gets explained after the big reveal. However, in the time it is just playing into the motif of the horror film. This Horror film offers much more than your typical jump scare, and tantalising suspense (though it does those well too). This movie contains layers upon layers of social and racial intentions and stereotypes; but again it portrays these in a rather unusual and original manner. This film takes every right wing social stereotype and completely flips them on its head. Not a single scene nor character in this movie is wasted, they all have a purpose and play an integral part in the storyline, with some playing even double and triple subliminal rolls, unbenounced to the viewer. The movie is quick to portray the typical white cop racially profiling a black man, stereotype, but Rose, quick to interject as the hero, intervening and standing up for her boyfriend in the face of the oppressive white cop. At least this is what is shown, and is expected to be interpreted from the scene. Ultimilty it is the viewer that is the one being played a fool, by some tricky double acting, with everything building up to the main reveal. Many family stories and tid bits are shared with Chris, aimed to be portrayed as the awkward stage of meeting someone new and inviting them into your home, but as the pieces fall into place, these interesting tales turn into rather disturbing hints. It isn't until the first night of Chris's stay that the viewer finally gets the first inklings to the threat surrounding Chris. Peele sets this reveal up so brilliantly that even though he is shouting the answers to the viewer, letting everyone know the truth to what is going on; the viewer is not fully convinced, and is still unaware of the intimate danger (or at least I still was). It is all explained and covered up by the answers provided to us by the scene, about Chris's mother and the nightmares he battles from the night she died. The subliminal hints dropped through the entirety of the film are perfectly disguised within the context of the film, as to not give too much away before the big reveal. Going into and throughout the course of movie, I was expecting an overtly racist, and simplistic storyline with an intriguing aspect of horror. What I got was entirely different, and masterfully intertwined with the social complexities that exist with minority groups. Rather than taking the typical approach and portraying the racism as a right wing, blatantly racist film, Peele went the other way entirely and portrayed the racism rather as an oversensitive ignorance, amongst left wing elitists. You know, the kind that say they would vote for Obama for a third term, but in reality don't have any sustainable, tangible relations with any black people. Peele, through angles, lighting, and mise en scene, is able produce discomfort in scenes, that is not reliant to the racial innuendos. Rather, the racial insinuations add more depth to the awkwardness and tie in to the full reveal. The characters still manage to come across offensive and itmindating, without overtly ruining the mystique of the movie by coming across overly aggressive. This film keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 104 minutes, with endarounds, double acting, and overlooked social layers. For an introductory independent film Peele displayed mastery of crucial aspects in the film industry allowing an entire audience to relate with Chris's discomfort even if the racial and political aspects fly over your head. Peele uses a complex shot combining both birds eye view, and worms eye view into one scene, really to drive home the point, while still managing to hide the big reveal. Suspense build throughout the movie with Chris's growing paranoia. The framing is excellent. There are aspects of omniscient perspective, where the viewer knows what's about to happen but the character doesn't. It all meshes perfectly and fluently. Showing the viewer just enough in any one scene, and then completely changing the topic to make them forget what they just saw. (I.E. the lawn mower is just one example of this.) All in all ""Get Out"" hits the mark on every aspect good horror movie ought to, and then it takes it ten steps further!"

193,"1/10 | After hearing all the great reviews and praises, while still avoiding any spoilers, I started to watch this movie prepared to love it.

I found it... silly.

Flat. Unsubtle and unoriginal. Absolutely zero scary. With an unsatisfying payout, and jarring changes in tone.

And not really very biting in its social commentary, too.

The only thing positive I can say about it is that it have its heart in the right place, but the execution...

Maybe the language of the movie failed me because I'm European and not American, I don't know, but I suspect that a good share of the praises the movie got were because it's on the few that are not loaded with jarring moral values, and I guess that especially in this historical moments that's quite important... still I truly look forward to a future with so many movies and work of art made with social awareness and wide representation of all, so that we can start praising movies that are *really* good in itself, and that being not morally repugnant is a given, not a special cause for praise."

The solution to the mystery of the film is just nonsensical and makes the drama of the entire first part of the movie feel like a cruel joke on whoever bought a movie ticket.

Don't waste your time on movie tickets, wait til it comes out on pay per view or comes out on DVD.

It is really a fresh take on the genre weaving a social message without any heavy handedness. Without giving away the story line, the movie is about an African American man with a white girl friend going home with her to visit her white parents. He has the trepidation any African American would face in this situation. Is the family racist? If so, how racist? Will there be lots of awkward conversations about African Americans? The tension builds in the film as the main character played by Daniel Kaluuya finds things getting stranger and stranger. Daniel Kaluuya gives an excellent performance playing the lead. He provides a wonderful low key performance with great deft and subtlety.

This film really deserves all the accolades.

201,"7/10 | This is probably my favorite movie of 2017, and probably one of the best psychological films out there.The dialogue and events that occur are all so relatable and engaging, and it's all highlighted my some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. I cannot properly express how impressed I am by the entire cast, and the psychological aspects were incredible!

The plot was very well written, however there were a few moments that confused me and there are a few glaring plot holes, and certain jump scares were rather cheap and could have easily been made more subtly. I personally found the ending to be quite anti-climactic and empty too, but nonetheless, I think Get Out certainly delivered the message it tried to send.

202,"7/10 | I gave this movie 8 stars, which for me is high praise indeed. On my first watch, I would have given it 2. That said, now that I have viewed this title several times I can truly appreciate what Jordan Peele is going for. It's not just a ""black and white"" film, and if you think it is - you miss the point.

Peele captures much of the ridiculousness of modern American society while also playing to those that think everything boils down to race. Is this is an oscar contender (little o intended) - who cares? All the film awards do is help already narcissistic overpaid morons celebrate themselves.

Does this film look at some serious stereotypes while making fun of so many of things we preoccupy ourselves with? Yes! To appreciate the humor and ""thrill"" of the film you must watch it more than once. Again, I consider myself a very conservative individual but still appreciate the humor to be found throughout this film.

If you didn't like it the first time, try it again - you might find some very clever things you missed. I have actually watched it about a half dozen times and find something new in every viewing."

205,"10/10 | This film was sadly lacking in every way: the story was thin and relied on cheesy 'explanation' set ups to try and condense some sense from the slightly drunk narrative. The dialogue was spare and dull; I didn't hear a single laugh in the half full cinema I saw this turkey. Also, the acting was in keeping with the story & script: awful. Daniel Kaluuya has always appeared in good things (Psychoville, Black Mirror) but he can't save what ends up being a film as intense as 'Scary Movie' without any laughs.

Get Out has been described as a genre-busting film but I found it to be a Sundance version of that. When I say Sundance, I mean a cheaply made film shot in the northern US states, usually in winter or fall, (autumn for us Anglos)with a dialogue driven narrative and therefore nothing of cinematographic interest nor musical.

My idea of a genre-busting film would be Shaun Of The Dead: it uses the genre of horror to drive the narrative but still has a very good script, distinctive characters and an equal blend of audio & visual highlights.

Get Out feels like a boring group of people made a film and then kidded everyone they were cool."
206,9/10 | 
207,"8/10 | I think it was watching The Last Blair Witch film that I first saw the trailer for this, and while I enjoyed that film, leaving the Cinema it was my memories of Get Out that I left with, I'm so often disappointed by films, having seen wonderful looking trailers, finally a movie that kills of that thinking.

Get out ranks as the Cinematic triumph of the year for me, the film was creepy, poignant, amusing, and I think highlighted the racial problems that still exist, in certain places.

Daniel Kaluuya is an actor, that sadly I've not paid a huge amount of attention too, I kept asking where do I know him from, a friend pointed out that as a fan of Psychoville I should have known. Kaluuya was outstanding, and I'll certainly be taking an active interest in his career from now on, hopefully awards will follow. Catherine Keener never disappoints, she provided the scene of the film for me, the therapy session, providing a moment of sheer terror.

Somehow too dark to be classed as a black comedy, but the satire was definitely apparent. I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray and enjoy it again. I know the ending was changed, I'm assuming with the possibility of a second, I hope they don't, this film deserved to be left alone as a true success.

Brilliant, 10/10"
208,"5/10 | I confess that I was slightly disturbed after this movie. LOL

Seriously, I was impressed with the script, not only because of the turn of the story, but also because there is a gender exchange in the middle of the movie, something natural that only then you realize that it was horror, that became comedy and in the end suspense. And what a fantastic performance of the protagonist!

209,"9/10 | Jordan Peele's cinematic debut is an astounding accomplishment for a genre that is commonly maligned as formulaic and inaccessible to broader audiences. What may first smack as a homage to the blaxploitation horror tradition, ""Get Out"" proves to be much more than any cliche attempt to elicit fear and unease purely through racial tension, gore, or cheap jump scares. Through the eyes of Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, we get a small taste of what it feels like to be truly uncomfortable in one's own skin. The tension is authentic, building into peaks of anxiety broken by stabs of humor, and sometimes the absurd (as can be Mr. Peele's inclination). Twists, turns, and a rousing climax complete an experience that wills surely engage from the opening scene to credits.

I can only think of a handful of moments where I lost immersion due to clumsy dialogue or clunky cinematography. Overall this film is highly deserving of it's Oscar and I will enjoy watching it again in the future. Mr. Peele and the entire cast obviously have incredible talent and I look forward to seeing more of their work."
210,"9/10 | Get Out gets a lot of credit where it doesn't deserve and not enough credit where it's due. Many have labeled it as a comedic commentary on race in contemporary American society, but it's really far from that. Yes, LilRel Howery is quite hilarious for most of it but Get Out really aims to thrill not to get laughs or cause a larger discussion on racial politics. The topic of race relations from Jordan Peele should be no surprise considering his past comedy sketches and personal mixed-race background and marriage. But his use of this material is to mainly work as a vehicle for tension and a tool to twist audience perception of what is really going on at this estate visit. A blatant example of this is Peele's smart directorial decision to change the original ending to one that tampers with our expectations and keeps political implications as an underlying subplot rather than the crux of the film. This works very well, drives the plot, our imaginations, and always has us wondering if our protagonist is justified in his paranoia or simply overreacting and misjudging the situation. As a horror/thriller Get Out has a refreshingly original premise with a skillfully witty and tightly constructed narrative plot but failed to evoke enough necessary fear for its own good. Peele makes a decent debut as a director but predominantly (and rightfully so) shows off his creative storytelling chops and attention to detail. But just as Chris misinterprets many people's interactions with him, audiences seem to misinterpret the ultimate point of this film."

212,"7/10 | 'Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher.

High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype.

It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread.

That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes.

Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively.

Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still.

While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most.

My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note.

Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

214,"7/10 | Many a cinephile might have lost all interest and hope in contemporary American films in recent years, but it turns out they might have just been looking at the wrong places. As the award-winning films of the country have become duller and duller, packed in a stale, tight corset, the most interesting auteurs have found their way in popular genre films which do not resonate that well with the businessmen who give out awards but which strike a deep chord with the general public. Long- time comedian, Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" (2017) is a perfect example, and it has already garnered well-deserved critical praise in France. Alongside the Safdies' ""Good Time"" (2017), another genre film which might go over the heads of the critics and award-givers who are used to the stale flow, ""Get Out"" is definitely among the best American films of the year. It should be seen by everyone not only for its social significance but also for its cinematic freshness.

An African-American photographer, Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) travels to his white girlfriend Rose's (played by Allison Williams) parents to visit them for the first time at their secluded estate somewhere in up-north countryside. The friendly atmosphere of this mundane meeting starts to crack and reveal something more sinister beneath the surface.

The basic set-up of the plot echoes the classic civil rights era film, Stanley Kramer's ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967) where a white woman introduces her African-American boyfriend to her liberal parents whose tolerance begins to show its limitations. Peele cleverly uses this inter-text as a backdrop, giving an undertone for the main theme, but essentially develops his film into something utterly original. Many spectators will leave the film with the thought that they have never seen anything like this. Never have the monsters of horror films felt so abstract and so concrete at the same time.

Peele is able to derive from his comedy-background the ability to build up tension in a fashion which often borders the line of humor without directing the spectator to laughs but rather to flinches in terror. Although ""Get Out"" does not come across as a self-aware meta-film dealing with the genre of horror like ""It Follows"" (2014), Peele's film does have a self-awareness to it which, however, never interrupts a scene or the development of suspense. Peele might use genre conventions with an ironic twinkle in his eye, but they are never subjected to any comprehensively genre-critical discourse. On the contrary, the self-aware genre conventions enhance the deeply felt structure of the film whose narrative power pushes the spectators tightly into their seats.

""Get Out"" begins with a serene shot of a wealthy American suburb where an African-American man is ambling, looking for the right street. This image in itself, mundane as its setting may be, already invokes feelings of horror because we have heard of so many stories where black men end up dead in innocent places such as these. It sets up an impressive and frightening sensation of not being welcomed which characterizes the film throughout. Peele's structured and disciplined mise-en-scène of precise compositions beautifully articulates and exemplifies the impression of a seemingly ""post-racial"" society where everything seems to be in order, but which conceals secrets underneath.

Overall, Peele's ""Get Out"" is a real cinematic treat and most likely will acquire a following. Whether the film skyrockets Peele to cinematic success or not will remain to be seen, for it is always the second film which shows if the director's first hit was just a stroke of luck. Yours truly is very confident -- as well as interested and hopeful for the future of contemporary American cinema."
215,"9/10 | I was pleasantly surprised by this film having not really heard of it before watching. Kudos to Jordan Peele as the writer and director of this horror-mystery piece, as I was indeed kept guessing throughout. On several occasions my hubris got the best of me, I thought I had the plot sussed - I was close, but no cigar. And I fully appreciated being taken down a different road than the one I had expected.

A strong performance from the cast en masse, but Daniel Kaluuya did stand out; since we are essentially watching events unfold as and when he experiences them. We cringe as he cringes, we're shocked as he's shocked.... and we, the audience, remain bonded to Daniel's character, Chris Washington, until the movie's conclusion - and in this way we feel like we are almost in the film ourselves. Immersed in a strange scenario, off to 'Meet the Parents', but with a twist of the unusual.

If you enjoy the mystery/horror genre, this film is unmissable. With horror films in particular being bogged down with the same type of characters and very similar plots, 'Get Out' comes as a refreshing change.

On the whole, I would recommend it to most viewers, horror fans and non-horror fans alike - the gore is not overwhelming."
216,"7/10 | was pleasantly surprised that it lived up to the ratings.

is atmospheric/suspenseful all the way through.

& it has an ending - that is an actual ending.

I imagine it will be a kind of cult film - from the outset. but that's maybe going too far.

217,"8/10 | A unique and effective blend of horror film and social commentary if there ever was one! Young black photographer Chris Washington is understandably nervous about going to spend the weekend with the parents of his sweet white girlfriend Rose Armitage-who for reasons unbeknownst to him has yet to tell her parents that he's black. They set out on their trip and...well the rest is really left for the viewer to discover. Writer-director Jordan Peele shows master craftsmanship by taking this simple premise and expanding it in many different directions, incorporating elements of racism, comedy, shock and awe, and wisely never taking things too seriously. The climax is a bit formulaic and over-the-top, but the journey is effectively unnerving and features much stronger acting than you would expect for a film of this genre. Not for everyone, but refreshingly unconventional and worth the viewing experience. ***

218,"9/10 | For a while I was becoming pretty convinced that it was impossible to make a movie that focuses solely on being a good movie. Not trying to throw in political themes or the director's private views so he could please people, no, just a damn good movie that's fun to watch!

Get Out is that movie, one which I have throughly enjoyed watching. It's a damn good horror movie because it has psychological horror about being powerless and trapped in a world you can't escape. That's really powerful and it's great to see a movie focus on this often unexplored psychological aspect of fear. It felt like watching a really good Twilight Zone episode that just so happened to have a black actor in the leading role. Daniel Kaluuya kills it as Chris Washington, he is such a cool everyman. You can really relate to this guy regardless of who you are, he seems like an average chill dude who you want to hang out with. This perfectly helps you relate to a character. He's our outlet into the story and our way of becoming immersed in the horror.

One thing that kinda frustrates me though is how everybody sees this movie. For those who call it politically correct nonsense about evil white society, I almost want to punch these idiots in the face! This isn't something like Mudbound where you instantly realize what the movie is about without even having to see it, Get Out pushes racism and white prejudice in the background so it can focus on the story, not the political climate it happens to be in. People who praise or hate this movie on the grounds that it tackles racism are people who didn't get the point of the movie. This movie is not about political themes but everybody thinks it is because it has white villains. For those people, leave your damn politics to CNN and just appreciate a movie because it's great!

Get Out is great, and if you like horror movie and want a good modern horror movie, give this a watch. I love the classics and I will adore movies like Frankenstein and Bram's Stoker's Dracula to death (literally), but sometimes I wanna watch a modern movie where the real villains are the monsters inside the people we think we know. It's a great movie. It's really fun! Go watch it!

9/10 great movie that holds up well and a welcome addition to the horror community!"
219,9/10 | 
220,"7/10 | Get Out in short: An African-American man meets his white girlfriend's parents, and their friends, and notices that there's something a little strange going on.

Racial undertones surround this really good horror-mystery film directed by a guy who has a (mostly) comedy background, Jordan Peele. Peele wades into deep waters filled with many horror greats swimming about. The question is, does he manage to stay afloat in this pool of great talent? Get Out is not without a little satire, but it's not the cheese comedy and clichés you sometimes see in bad horror films, it works here, it's smart. But it is a horror film, after all, and a damn good one too. So yes, Peele's floaties are working just fine.

As a viewer, you instantly pick up the vibe going on right from the start. Director Jordan Peele, whose mother is white and father is black, sets the mood early and keeps reminding you of it. Chris, a black man, is dating a white woman, Rose. Nothing unusual about that, but for reasons that soon become clear, a big deal is made from it. Rose brings Chris home (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner-esq) to an affluent neighborhood filled with old money and old white people who ""act as if they've never met a real black man before."" Suddenly, the geriatric's are referring to black stereo types, like, ""I'm a big fan of Tiger Woods,"" or, ""Is it true what they say about black men in bed."" People are getting creepy, if not rude, looking him over - sizing him up almost like cattle at an auction. Chris' best friend, Rod the TSA worker (and proud of it) ominously warns, ""You don't go to a white girl's parent's house!"" Even I began to feel sketched out!

Two things you'll LIKE about Get Out: 1) The story is brilliant. Peele also wrote the script (2018 Oscar nominee for both Original Screenplay and Director). It's unique and unexpected. 2) It's the best horror film since The Shining (1980).

Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) You may be a little uncomfortable with the racial undertones at first, perhaps even embarrassed for your entire race (if you're white). Give the move a chance to make the point of it all. 2) It may be a few more years until you see a horror-mystery like this one again. Soak it up while you can."
221,"7/10 | Now I dont think this film is the kind of film you'll stay up all night cowering in fear wondering about what evil is lurking around the corner. At least it wasnt that kind of horror film to me. It's more psychological. And it does make you think about what its like to be black in this world. And for all those saying this film is ""racist"", I dont think that was Jordan's intent. He is married to a white woman, I dont think he seriously thinks all white people are evil. I see it more as ""Not everything always appears to be as it is"" cautionary tale. And also a bit of social commentary on those who think racism is long and dead just because there arent public lynchings anymore. Yes, we have made strides since the Civil Rights Moment. But its still there. And thats what I think the film was trying to say. Everything might look rosy and cheerful on the outside, until you get into the thick of it. And I think it was an interesting topic to handle. Jordan Peele did a really good job of tackling it and in an new, exciting way.

Also from a horror point, ""The Sunken Place"" is really creepy. The score also is on point. Its more of a slow burn. But that doesnt mean its boring. Jordan does a good job of leaving you little clues here and there that somethings not quite right and it helps to build up to the climax.

In terms of comedy, Lil Rel Howery (who plays the best friend role) is the comic relief. He is the one that gets all of the funny lines. That being said, I definitely dont really consider this a comedy. It never felt a comedy to me. So for those that are expecting laughs, you might be disappointed.

Daniel Kaluuya though is phenomenal in this film and I'll be rooting him on during awards season.

Overall, I really enjoyed this film and Im impressed that this was Jordan's directorial debut."
222,9/10 | 
223,"7/10 | Not all the directional debut sees this kind of welcome from the audience. Yeah, Jordan Peele had written and directed it. It is similar to the 90s style mystery-thrillers. Definitely must see for the 90s, 80s guys. It kind of looked like a black comedy, but I guess that's not they had preferred. Especially that teacup scenes and some of the close up shots, that freaks, yet very funny.

Well, this is the story of an interracial romance. When Chris decides to meet his girlfriend's white family, living outskirt of her hometown, all goes as planned. But he was not sure how her parents take it, that he's a black. Now everything has settled, but his visit started to take a strange turn after a series of weird events. What it is and how he overcomes it is the remaining tale.

The casting was amazing. The story was suspenseful. You would feel you can predict the scenes, but not that easy and when twist happens, you will realise it was simple as that. This is a hit film now, but if it was 20 years ago, surely would have gotten a cult classic status. And yes it is, thinking the future.

When this got out and its pre release, I thought it would disappear without any trace. It is rare a recognition a film like this to get to having a second string cast, debutante director and being a low cost film. I got entertained thoroughly as it delivered as promised. But I think some people are overjoyed and praising it like crazy. That's true if you are not a film fanatic, otherwise it is one of those decent films. Surely not to be missed. One of the best of this year.

Note 9.5"
226,"1/10 | With the large advertising budget, there's a good chance you've seen the trailer, and there's also a good chance you just saw the IMDb trailer, but I need to preface that the best viewing experience will be found if you know nothing about the story beforehand. (I will not talk about any specific events or characters in the movie.)

Story: 'Get Out' is a great 'journey-type' horror movie that is most strong and reliant on its tone and build-up. The movie is very good in these aspects, and makes the whole narrative well-done overall because of it, even withstanding a weaker ending in my opinion. But that will happen with a lot of the aforementioned 'journey-type' horror movies. Essentially things build-up and build-up to a certain point, and the ending releases everything. Regardless of what the ending is like, that journey is what holds the primary value. (Ex. The Shining (1980), The Witch (2016).) In that sense, I will leave off saying in watching this movie for its story, it's good but not great.

Cinematography: Scenery and sets are really well-shot in this movie. Some events in the latter-half of the film have settings that really stand-out, especially on a second watch. Most of 'Get Out' is shot on one property with a large house and yard surrounded by forest. Scenes inside the 'office' and the basement are prevalent scenes when it comes to cinematography, among others. I will say that the camera-work is good overall but it doesn't utilize any elements to establish any more suspense or creepiness outside of the script and some really good acting. (More or less these statements apply to the former-half of the movie, because there are some creepy shots in the latter.)

Film Score: Even as a lover of music in movies, I didn't feel much from this track. The score is somewhat generic but well-used, so it didn't impact the merit of the film, but it could have earned a higher rating from me if it did stand-out.

Overall: I recommend this movie to anyone that can enjoy a good suspense-filled movie. Even though it is weird and a bit twisted on a superficial level, it's not very bad whatsoever and other than some language. (And yes, there's some practical blood effects but that just makes the film better in my taste.) I would even recommend this to younger (13+) and more general audiences alike, it's not a very hard 'R' to me. It definitely doesn't beat out 2016's 'The Witch', which it's most comparable to in tone, but it is a very solid movie."
227,"9/10 | I was surprised by this film but not impressed. Acting was excellent but I'm not convinced the writer/directors intent is forward thinking. If anything, the humor is at the expense of white people and even more insulting to bi-racial people. What black people perceive as racist is really ignorance at its most embarrassing.

229,"8/10 | Big fat caveat: the movie probably deserves a 2 or 3 star rating, but I have to do my bit to bring the average rating down from 7.8 (!!!) that made me watch the movie in the first place!!

So we went in all excited (because of that rating!), thinking and hoping this would be a combination of Don't Breathe and House of Wax but it didn't have the excitement, mystery and horror of either! All shock-scenes are basically in the trailer. The plot was shocking - there was a lot of build up -- it lasted for 75-80% of the movie! The last 15-20 mins of the movie were nothing - everything was rushed into, and it all seemed too predictable and easy for the lead cast.

Result: A very very sub-standard movie.

Recommendation: Don't bother. Not even on DVD."

231,"8/10 | Get out is the first movie, that I've seen at least, to take the racial paranoia that is present in our culture and exploit it to make a horror film. And while I was watching this film I began to realize how well Jordan Peele can blend comedy and horror when I was laughing and getting nervous at the same time throughout the film. Jordan does a fantastic job of building tension while also layering the film with his humorous point of view. So that there is an atmosphere of satire all throughout the film. I also have to respect that this is not an easy film to write, given the touchy subject matter. It could have very easily come out as racist or ignorant, however the comical undertones gave the film a tongue-and-cheek sort of vibe. And the paranoia I experienced in this film is actually one that is prevalent in our culture today. And even if the racial subject matter is very touchy, horror is not supposed to be kind towards our sensibilities, it is supposed to take something that scares us in real life and escalate it so that it can horrify an audience for around two hours. This one just happened to have a nice satirical edge to it. However, the film did feel short to me. There were some major plot holes in the film. One phenomena involving a phone that contributes to the plot in a big way is never explained. The twist in the film is very entertaining. However after the twist the story feels kind of rushed. There does not seem to be any sense of patience or building tension. It is more of just a transition from a horror movie to, all of the sudden, an action movie. I would have liked it to be longer. There is a lot of potential for more material in the film. The directing in the film is really eerie and well executed. I get kind of a Hitchcockian vibe from his directing style. There may be some influence from John Carpenter in there, which is hilarious given the satirical nature if the film. I did not expect Jordan to come off as such a seasoned filmmaker. He proves that he has a knack for bringing work to the big screen and I look forward to seeing more work from Jordan in the future. Less Keanu, more of this!"
232,"8/10 | I didn't have any expectations about this movie. I avoided reading reviews and anything, just so I would be surprised. Unfortunately, I didn't see this one on the big screen. I liked the movie, a lot. Horror? It is in a certain way. Racism, of course. It is an American movie with Southern story background, come on, this is like American cliché right there. But it is OK. We all know how races is a big deal in the US. It is maybe the only country where you are forced to think you have a race. I mean, let's not hypocrites here but in the US, it really matters. It is like people are curious to know what mix have you been blended with? Get some white, black, Asian...put in the blender and ... there you are!! It doesn't take the originality of the movie and I don't think it is a big deal but there it is. The white people talking, African-American talking...but it is still good.

233,"7/10 | Having heard nothing but raves about this film and how scary it is, I caught its return to the theaters. For starters, I'll say this. Get past the first 15-20 minutes, because initially it comes across as cartoonish and obvious and gives no indication of how clever and brash it's going to become. But a sharp soundtrack early on gives a hint of something to come.

This mystery story of a young couple, black man and his white girlfriend meeting the latter's parents in their suburban house quickly sheds its cookie cutter aura and becomes something brazen and ominous as the family members are introduced. The film pulls no punches in landing one stereotypcial gag after another. If you're a politically correct individual who cannot stand any kind of racially-charged digs, this film isn't for you. I found the jokes to be so shameless and the satire so biting, that it made a film about race relations in this day and age seem almost carefree. And although it does have some isolated horror elements, this is a suspense film through and through.

Don't get me wrong. The humor aside, this movie is not afraid to get its hands dirty. But the outrage is really on mute. This is not the kind of film that should stir up strong emotions for the simple reason that it's so escapist and cheerfully juvenile. At the same time, despite its sheer style and witty screenplay, I don't see this film winning Best Picture. Happily recommended."
234,"9/10 | When I look beyond the obvious race related message the film offers us, I still see an excellent and entertaining modern day movie masterpiece. ""Get Out"" is a creative, unique, and witty movie that I am so happy has gotten Oscar recognition (it's sort of what ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" was in 2015 in terms of an unexpected Best Picture nominee) as it will likely lead to more original voices being heard within the mainstream cinema (I can also say the same about many of the other nominees this year, ""The Shape of Water"" and ""Three Billboards"" both being primary examples). The subject matter the film tackles is clearly pretty heavy handed stuff, and is worked into the movie quite well once you get used to it. Racism has almost been used as a cinematic convention at this point, every year there's the new ""racism is bad"" Oscar bait flick, but ""Get Out"" pleases with its subversion of convention, as ""Get Out"" plays provocatively around with genre. At once it works as a mystery-thriller, a horror movie, a comedy, and a drama, and never does a tonal shift feel wrong or out of place. Everything in this movie serves a genuine purpose, which I have to applaud Jordan Peele on as I know that's not easy for a writer to really do. I mean, this is a brilliantly planned out film, scene by scene it stuns and entertains and the 100 minute run time feels more like a 50 minute run time. Really impressive stuff, and a directorial debut no less!"
235,9/10 | 
236,"2/10 | As you may guess from the submission date, I'm reviewing ""Get Out"" several months after its cinematic release. Unfortunately, the months of glowing notices have generated an anticipation in me, which no film could possibly have lived up to.

This is not to say that it's not good. Jordan Peele directs well, but it's his writing that is one of the core strengths of the picture. There is such depth to it the screenplay, not only with its allegories and metaphors, but also with subtle foreshadowing and lines with multiple meanings. There are many layers to be ""unpeeled"" (pun intended) on repeat viewings.

The other strength is Daniel Kaluuya. A regular face on UK TV for a while now and with a few smaller roles in Hollywood productions, Kaluuya is brilliant and this should be a career-making performance.

So, what doesn't work as well? Essentially, it's the films third act. I try to write my reviews without spoilers and I will here, but the film takes a leap into science fiction towards the end that stretches your willingness to go along with it. It's an idea that make sense figuratively but not literally. Also, Chris transitions a little too far into action hero territory, given that there's been nothing to justify that, save some talk about Judo lessons.

Provided you're not anticipating horror in the traditional sense, ""Get Out"" is a smart genre mingling effort. Not perfect, but certainly not bad for a debut film."
237,"1/10 | Like everyone else who saw this movie, I was really surprised by Jordan Peele's directorial debut. It had the perfect balance of tension and comedy that I haven't seen in a while. Turning the premise of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" into an absolute nightmare. Unpredictable, intense and hilarious with a terrific character arc performed fantastically by Daniel Kaluuya. If you're the one person who hasn't seen this yet, go check it out, it's good!

238,"4/10 | I want to thank Jordan Peele for not taking the easy road and following his own vision to full execution. I know the ending may be too convenient for some - but the moment it happened it was forgiven given the genre he was in. There are indelible scenes in this movie, and that takes a special skill and certainly some luck. I can't imagine how hard it would be to go from an idea and a dream to a grueling work schedule worrying about money and everything else and end up with a massive data base of footage - and then to start working again to create an authentic manifestation of that original idea - just amazing, especially for a first time director. MUCH RESPECT!

239,"7/10 | I'll make this brief, as others have already made excellent points regarding the enormous amount of undeserved hype surrounding this film. In summary:

1. Anyone who tells you that there is a ""twist"" ending is lying to you. Twenty minutes into the film it becomes apparent exactly where this is going..............with zero surprises.

2. Each and every bit of comedy in the film falls flat, which should tell you something about a director who supposedly makes his living writing sketch-comedy.

3. This film is completely devoid of nuance, a comment that Tyler Perry himself has said about his own films in interviews.

In closing, the most disappointing aspect of this film is that there isn't much here to discuss. Just a bunch racially-charged stock thriller-tropes with a ""lifetime movie"" level plot. Much like Ranchero music, this is art for the dumb.

Suggestions: Beyond the Black Rainbow, Black Mirror, Don't Breathe, Green Room"
240,"8/10 | After all the rave I saw on rotten tomatoes I thought I was in for a treat. There is no suspense, no good acting, no credible script that even a old spaghetti horror movie couldn't out pass. This a prime example of cheating audiences through directed marketing. Avoid at all costs.

241,"7/10 | Firstly, Daniel Kaluuya is superb as the lead, if it wasn't for him I would have not bothered much after the 45 minute mark, it is that dull. Some would say it's a brooding 45 mins etc, but c'mon we know it's a horror so get on with it. Critics will give it extra for the obvious reasons but the last 20 mins give it the kudos, so stick with it during the moments you're shouting ""Get on with it"".

245,"9/10 | Get Out is a best movie of this life.

I was basically watching MadTV starring Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Whoever gets recently starring in a action movie in 2016, ""Keanu"" along with Method Man, Will Forte, Luis Guzman and Jason Mitchell. However, it was a comedy-horror film called ""Get Out"" would notified basis of Eddie Murphy film. Suddenly, the black folks would hear ""GET OUT"" and they've split.

Daniel Kaluuya was the good actor in a movie and I really like the final fight scene. Because, it's more than way often than the other horror movies. But Allison Williams from Girls on HBO, will make her feature film debut. I'm very good about that movie. It was the great movie of ever made.

Don't you get worried about Oscars."
246,"9/10 | I stuck with this for nearly 40 minutes because of good reviews. Found it tedious and slow. Acting good, but storyline awful. No suspense, trite and predictable. Amazed RT gave this 99%, I would rate it one star one a scale of one to five. Usually I agree with the RT consensus Seemed like a film school project.

247,"9/10 | This movie probably fools everyone with the opening scene, after which you'll be guessing what the real genre, horror, thriller, drama etc. is. After that beginning, the atmosphere changes back to getting to know the characters. Without too much development, it keeps a perfect pace, to keep you wondering what's next.

A likable but not overacting or bland character, in a new environment that will keep everyone still guessing, will end up in a situation in which the viewer will rapidly realize what ""the sunken place"" is, without losing all credibility.

One creepy party and one revelation later, the viewer will finally know what genre, and what kind of movie we are watching. A movie that reinvents creepy movies, with the only small flaw being that after the twist, things go (too) fast. Everything else, acting, characters, surroundings, works perfect!!

248,"9/10 | I decided to see this thriller movie when I saw it got 8.1 on IMDb.com. It is about a black man being chased into a strange family living in a spooky house in countryside. What makes the film interesting is that the suspense is maintained till the end. The plot is very well written and realistic. The film is regular paced without any boring scenes and it follows a logical sequence. All the conversations are related to the subject. The Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor. I did not know him before. But I can tell he is very promising and we should definitely see him again in other great movies. It goes without saying that Jordan Peele is very successful both as a writer and as a director. Overall performance of the cast is very good. Congratulations to them all.

This is how a movie is shot!!!

249,"9/10 | Well...

My first review, this is. So please, don't mind, if it's not good enough!

So yeah... The movie was quite nice. I watched it before knocking myself out.

I really think the acting could have been a bit better? But, this is something I noticed personally, you can disagree.

One thing though, I was really falling for Allison! :P Not sure if this is something I should include in my review.

And yeah, the ending was satisfying, for sure, for me! :)

Even though I loved the movie, but I still think there was something ""Missing"", that's the reason I'm giving it 9 out of 10. But, usually, I give all the movies a perfect 10 score, and don't write a review, either."
250,"10/10 | This was a very well rounded film. When it was first released, I noticed that Rotten Tomatoes gave this movie a 100% rating, which immediately got my attention. Not only was the concept brilliant, but it brought what many movies do not: humor, suspense, emotional attachment to the characters, and surprises. I feel like that's hard to accomplish all into one film, but this one achieved it. I would highly recommend this movie. I really enjoyed it and so did all of my friends.

251,"8/10 | Spoiler free

The thriller is a dying genre. What we have today is ACTION- thrillers. Ones that have car chases and big shootouts. Jordan Peele has proved Thriller is not completely dead. H uses excellent cinematography to build suspense and fright. The whole movie looks beautiful. Next is the acting. Daniel Kaluuya is perfect in this role. All of the family is eery and fits like a glove into the movie. Allison Williams is particularly convincing. The one problem I have is the building of suspense is a tad slow and the first two acts only increase in quality as it progresses. The third act is stunning and held my breath. It left smart references to the days of slavery and terms used my slave owners in the south. The humor is sharp and dark at most times(the Dahmer rant anyone?). Please go and see films like this and not ""Ghost in the Shell"", ""Smurfs"", or any film that treats it's audience like money

253,"7/10 | This is not a film for White People. I say this because I sat in a theatre with a diverse group of people and noticed the white people in the audience seemed offended by the film. Even though I am black, I believe this film was very well done. The casting director did an amazing job with the cast, all the actors were very believable in their roles. This is truly a unique cinematic experience, I've spent a great deal of time watching films from different parts of the world and its rare for me to say that I've never seen a film like this before. This is one of those films that makes white people look bad, but to be fair it does a great job in capturing the experience of a black man surrounded by ""too many white people"". For instance, I've almost always been the only black person at my job, and I've had my boss ask me about certain rappers simply for the fact that I'm black. During the summer olympics, my boss literally asked me what it was like to see black people win gold medals for America. My boss is not a racist, but often makes ignorant comments just like this film depicts.

Kudos to Jordan Peele!!! I hope to see more from him.

257,"9/10 | 'Get Out' is billed as a horror film, but - no spoilers in this review! - it's really more of a mystery/tense thriller. It's shot really well and looks great (nice effort from first-time director Peele), with some smart use of the Alabama location and a good score. The premise is purposefully cryptic: ""African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate"". Chris (Kaluuya) is meeting Rose (Williams) parents - Missy (Keener) & Dean (Whitford) - for the first time, and they welcome him with open arms, even if the servants seem off.

It's not all about race, but it is a key aspect of the film and handled quite well. The two leads easily carry the film, both having some great scenes. However, the best bits are probably whenever Chris' friend Rod (Howery) is on screen, being hilarious and boisterous, even though often by phone. The humour and some slow bits do well to make the surprises seem even more shocking.

The twist isn't as big as 'Cabin in the Woods' or 'The Sixth Sense', but the final 20min is certainly one of the better endings to a thriller/horror film you'll see for a while! Bit of a slow build up in parts, but a very exciting finish and it's all over in 100min."
258,"7/10 | Best Picture Nominee:

I've seen ""Get Out"" twice now. Once with a group of friends way after it released on Blu-Ray and the second time in theaters during the Oscars 2017 Best Picture Festival and both times I have loved this film.

""Get Out"" strikes this perfect balance of being a comedy and a horror film, while simultaneously being social commentary about racism.

The political message works really well here, but it's not the only thing going for it, which can often times be the case for films that push a strong political agenda.

The entire cast did so well, that I was scared for Chris and genuinely creeped out by the entire Armitage family. The setup is near perfect, building up the appropriate amount of suspense that we needed for the later half of the film, with the ending keeping me on the edge of my seat literally until the very last scene.

I'm glad that ""Get Out"" won Best Screenplay and if it had won Best Picture, I wouldn't have complained at all. If you haven't seen it yet, go give it a watch!"
259,"8/10 | In an unnamed U.S. city, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is an African-American photographer. His white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams), whom he has been seeing for about four months, asks him to join her to meet her family for the first time. At the country's family estate, Chris notices some odd events which lead him to think he could be in danger.

Director/writer Jordan Peele has created a superb thriller that easily reminds one of the brilliant ""Stepford Wives"" (1975). The tension slowly builds with the viewer identifying with Chris. The strange events seem harmless at first but there are too many coincidences to dismiss. Once the pieces come together, it's easy to see why the film was given its title.

""Get Out"" is not without its comical moments especially stupid comments from well-meaning ""good, white liberals"" which peak at a massive garden-party-from-hell. As a modern psychological horror-thriller with an unique perspective on racism, it's easy to see why ""Get Out"" has earned so much recognition during the current awards season. It does borrow heavily from ""The Stepford Wives"" but clearly adds its own special, creative spin on the ""people here sure are weird"" atmosphere. - dbamateurcritic"
260,"7/10 | I am not a fan of horror genre. I don't enjoy being scared. And I am so glad it didn't stop me from seeing Get Out. It's not the kind of horror that makes you afraid of the dark, or of showers, or whatever innocent inanimate objects. The horror is in the meaning. The movie takes common, casual racism and what-ifs it to a whole other level. Plausibility of the horrific things that happen or lack thereof (that can be an undoing of a movie like this for me) is irrelevant here. It's the symbolism that matters. And this symbolism is very subtle, never in your face. The film delivers a message, yet never appears to be trying to say something.

The lead and supporting actors are all great, but I want to give special kudos to Marcus Henderson (Walter), Betty Gabriel (Georgina), and Laketh Stanfeld (Andre Logan King). They had the hardest jobs and they were fantastic. The story flows smoothly. There is never a false moment that could throw you out of the movie's hypnotic grip. I thought Chris's mother's death was a bit overexploited, but that is such a small complaint, I wouldn't even count it as one. The film is nothing short of shockingly brilliant."
261,"7/10 | Daniel Kaluuya gives a subtle and relatable performance along with a fantastic supporting group of actors and actresses. One of the best ""horror"" movies I can remember.

264,"8/10 | This film manages to encapsulate quite a few themes. We have here a psychological thriller/horror which has themes on race and standing.

The film begins with our lead (a young black man) who is to visit the white family of his well to do girlfriend. As you are to find out, not all is at it seems.

I don't wish to say too much more on the story as it will easily give too much away. The film can be quite derivative, and as you watch it, there are various films you can clearly see which influenced it.

However, that doesn't take away from the gist of what is here. There are racial themes that will make you ponder on it all way after you've watched it, which is what this is all about. It make it interesting, but it doesn't shove any political agendas down your throat.

The acting is great, with some recognisable cult film actors present. Special mention must go to LilRel Howery who provides some comedy and tension relief in an otherwise very dark but often darkly humorous movie.

I enjoyed it despite the uncomfortable nature of it. Worth a try, and a good entry in the horror genre for this year."
265,"9/10 | An unheralded cash cow in its domestic revenue and also a succès d'estime, USA black comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut GET OUT rides on the coattail of the racial powder keg in the current USA soil, conjures up a well-conceived conspiracy theory married with an aroused scenario taking the leaf from the time-tested suburbia genre book, a close cousin is Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIFES, and enlivens its central story with robust horror tropes pulsating in a bracing beat.

Our virile hero is Chris Washington (Kaluuya), a black photographer who is going to meet his white girlfriend Rose Armitage's (Williams) family for the first time. What Chris encounters is not the hostile racism usually presides within uncouth hillbillies or religious-poisoned happy clappies, instead, in this close-knit WASP community, what lurks around is something much more sinister and beyond one's wildest imagination. The overt clue is the aberrant behaviors of the black servants living with the Armitages: the housekeeper Georgina (Gabriel) and groundskeeper Walter (Henderson). At first glance, Peele seems to dangle viewers with a more conventional reference of slavery, but correlating with the film's unsettling prologue of abducting a black man Andrew Hayworth (Stanfield) in the same neighborhood, a sober mind suggests that we cannot take the situation for granted, certainly, something is wrong with the black people on the lot, they are not themselves, but the voodoo in the mix hits more on the mark of deep-rooted illusion of immortality than the ostensible white supremacy, there is a nuanced overtone even eulogizing black race's vitality as the perfect human specimen, meanwhile the main trope vouchsafes what lies beneath is the turpitude of extreme selfishness which deprives others of their identity (brain) for one's own sake, a metaphor of power-abusing from those privileged few, which is part and parcel of the film's runaway success, viewers cannot help but paralleling it with the current political affairs in the Trump era - life can be a sick joke.

Artistically speaking, Peele rounds up a coherent (albeit improbable) story arc within its suburbia milieu, an estate is quietly ensconced with quaint Americana, a retro luster contradicts the young couple's modernist urbanity. From that symbolic deer-in-the-headlight accident to the para-psychic hypnosis, to a superbly and literally devised sunken place (evoking the murky other-worldliness in Jonathan Glazer's UNDER THE SKIN 2013), until the mandatory but still engrossing bailing-out killing spree, GET OUT treads circumspectly through the familiar ground without overdosing in the wantonness of its cock and bull story.

Credits should fairly given to a capable cast, Daniel Kaluuya makes for a straight-up hero with gaping intensity, and Allison Williams capitalizes in Rose's about-face veracity to a bone-chilling effect. LilRel Howery as Chris' best friend, a TSA officer, stands out as the comic foil and a mouthpiece of inappropriate one-liners, and an openly hearty Bradley Whitford, a beguilingly frosty Catherine Keener and a delirious Caleb Landry Jones, rounds out an unsettling dysfunctional family, last but not the least, Betty Gabriel, arguably leaves the most bizarre impression perfectly in line with the thematic out-of-body creepiness.

For all its hype and buzz, GET OUT benefits greatly from its timing and present-day context, plus a genuinely appealing wheeze of identity-swapping. A miracle-maker borne out of an above-average commodity that no one should begrudge for its success, because it excels as a trenchant social critique in spite of its genre setting, which is dishearteningly wanting in most wide-opening theatrical staples, especially at a dejected time like this."
266,"8/10 | Get Out is one of the best horror movies of this century. He is very creative, that is the business. He does not follow the formulas of these new horror films, he manages to be impeccable in this matter. Jordan Pelee, a likely marijuana user, because to write a story of that caliber has to smoke something, it's the head of that movie. He is very original in every way. The actors are very well, Daniel Kaluuya with only 29 years of breaking up on paper. The movie is going to suck you, but it's not that big, it's small. For you who did not watch will be surprised.

267,"9/10 | I have to admit that I only watched this because I came across it by flicking through a list of films after a slow night were nothing was on TV.

But to my utter surprise, the film had me gripped and this resulted in me wanting to jump into the film and help the guy. Instantly, I felt like I was part of the film and loved the characters diverse, strange, freakish, demeanour. Coupled with the brilliant acting skills that made you believe the whole thing could actually happen.

The comedic timing was great and I would love to say more about the acting skills of one of the female characters, but this would only give things away and that isn't my intention.

But bravo to all involved and the lead actors were outstanding.

Loved the film, great surprise watch that was well worth it..

Would I watch it again? Yes I would."
268,"9/10 | The movie was emotional and heart felt from the outset. Romantic themes are present throughout showing how love can be wrecked by tragedy. The music builds tension well and the characters are distinctive and unique.

Control is a key theme throughout which gets transferred regularly. This keeps things engaging and shows how easy it is for sides to change. The plot is anything but heart felt and is certainly sinister enough to warrant the horror genre. All parts seem played well by the cast and the movie doesn't scrimp on effects or acting/ surrounding scene quality.

Perhaps it's appeal is how real it seems both emotionally and through strong acting . scenes eliminate the need for gimmicks and gremlins.

269,"8/10 | In retrospect - Perhaps the best way to experience this film is to read nothing, including genre classifications. It is extremely well written, acted and directed and is unlike so many movies out there - new clothes for an old body. This film is unusual in so many respects - from the symbolic scenes and gestures, and the music choices to the way it unfolds. After watching this film, I felt like I'd read a very satisfying book. More than most films I've seen in recent years, I really wanted to watch it again after having a fuller understanding of everything it contains. Sure, there were some 'plot twists' that I saw coming right from early into it, however these didn't diminish my enjoyment of seeing it all unfold.

Thankfully, I did come here and read some of the ""Spoiler Alert"" Trivia. It revealed a few things that I would have missed. Obviously this is a film worth talking about with others, seeing again, rethinking, etc. On the other hand, I felt the name was very poorly chosen. Right from the first time I saw it advertised, I just about overlooked it, as the name, combined with the genre, suggested that it wasn't probably the kind of film that would interest me. I'm so glad that I decided to check it out. I suspect different people will have very different reactions to it. It touches on some serious points, strikes unexpected nerves, and has some very unpredictable scenes.

Hard to believe that this is a first time director.

A very strong piece of work, with great contributions from most departments: (preproduction, production and post production)

UNFORGETTABLE!"
270,"8/10 | Once i saw initial trailer of the movie and i thought i had actually seen the entire movie. The plot of the movie had been so exposed in the trailer i didn't bother watching the movie for 7 months since it premiered. I would clearly rate the suspense as 7 out of 10, character portrayal of Chris Washington 9 out 10 and the rest of the cast 8 out of 10. Otherwise i liked it.

This is the kind of movie that you can watch hundreds of times and continue to find new connections and subtle clues. Not a single scene in the movie is wasted, and unique to this movie, I finally feel like my time as the audience was valued.

'Low budget horror movie' is no longer a second name for a terrible movie. I want to congratulate Jordan Peele and all involved on this beautiful work of art, I hope to see many more of this quality!

272,"8/10 | Here in Portugal, Get Out was released later so I actually watched it at home ... twice. Yes, a movie like this needs a second watch, a more focused look at the details and a more concentrated mind to find all the clues to the expected twist in any genre film like this one. Well, I'm happy to say that Get Out is right up there in the contenders' list for the best movie of 2017 so far!

I never was a big fan of horror movies, but as time goes by I keep enjoying them more and more (maybe before I just watched the pretty bad ones). I didn't know the cast, but I did know Jordan Peele ... However, not as a director. My God, how great is he?! Excellent directing skills throughout the whole runtime: amazing camera-work (some cool long takes), efficient jump-scares with the adequate loud and brief background sounds, but his major achievement is definitely the screenplay. Thought-provoking, disturbing and it handles racism and any preconceptions in a way that, by the end, floored me. Great concept, executed seamlessly.

The unknown cast (to me, at least) is just an awesome surprise. Everyone shines in this brilliant movie and elevate it to a super captivating story that already has a fantastic mystery and intrigue surrounding it. Daniel Kaluuya is unbelievably amazing, all of the actors portraying the Armitage's family and housekeepers are equally spectacular and LilRel Howery (Rod Williams) is amazing as the comic relief guy.

The tone switches a lot throughout the film. Peele goes from comedy to horror, from drama to thriller in an instant, but it's so well- directed that its fluidity is near perfection. Also, the editing is flawless to my knowledge and the way he depicted and explored every preconception and racist stereotype is really brilliant.

A movie definitely worth watching, at least, twice. It has a huge replay value and I already see it as a horror classic.

Does it have flaws? Unfortunately, it does ... In the smallest details, but it does. Watching a second time I couldn't help to notice that some scenes are just weird, with no real meaning behind it. Rose's backstory is my main and only issue with the screenplay, but I really can't get more in-depth than this unless I spoil it for you, which I won't. I can just say that there's a plot point that I still struggle to accept/understand.

There are also some exposition scenes that could have been handled differently and the pacing dragged a little bit in the second act, but it didn't affect me that much since the writing is so great that it almost passed by without me really noticing.

Get Out is probably the most underrated movie in Portugal so far and I'm thrilled that I was able to catch it and watch it twice. Jordan Peele proves that his directing skills are something extraordinary, his screenplay is pure brilliance and his cast is unquestionably incredible, starting on the protagonist, Daniel Kaluuya, to LilRel Howery, the man behind the comedy bits in the film. A very important and thought-provoking movie with social preconceptions on other races explored to the tiniest detail, that only fails to deliver a precise backstory to Rose and it has some really minor issues with its second act's pacing and exposition scenes."
273,"8/10 | This has been the one film that has come out this year that I missed in the cinema but I have now see get out and I really enjoyed this film. The premise of the film sees a young black man go and meet his white girlfriend's family, he seems to notice that something weird might be going on. Daniel kaluuya is a new actor to me and he plays the lead in this film and he is fantastic in this film. You are rooting for his character so much throughout this film as you are really watching this film through his eyes. He is very likable in the film that makes him a great character. Allison Williams is his girlfriend in this film and she is good in this film, they have very good chemistry together and you are behind there relationship succeeding. Lilrel Howery plays his friend in this film and he is hilarious in this film, his dialogue is great throughout the whole film and is really funny in the film. The entire cast does a great job with the roles they are given and all the characters are interesting to watch. The story is pretty fascinating as you see this guy try and get used to his new surroundings while trying to work out was is actually wrong. However, even though entertaining I felt the end of this film to be a bit rushed and I could have done with an extra 15 or 20 minutes of details. The script is great, the blend of humour and drama is really well handled and makes this more unique then expected. The style of the film has so much great tension that truly sucks you in to follow and try and work out what is going on. But I wasn't a huge fan of some of the more trippy off the walls scenes that took me out of the serious nature of this film. Overall this is a great film with so much great social commentary and should definitely be seen."
274,"9/10 | A movie that truly keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't remember the last time a thriller movie got me emotionally exhausted , even the comedy scenes were much needed in this movie , especially with very intense non violent scenes, the conversations alone were pretty intense. Unlike most mystery movies the ending is not disappointing nor over the top. Saying anything else will probably ruin the movie.

275,"8/10 | Get Out is the directorial debut from comic Jordan Peele and tells the story of Chris, an African American man meeting his white girlfriend's parents for the first time at their secluded home in the woods. With all the praise surrounding Get Out, I tried to go in with an open mind not letting the hype overwhelm for what could be an ""O.K."" film. However after seeing it, the praise its well deserved. This is a meticulous, well-crafted film, that offers both frights and moments of laughter. I was thoroughly impressed by how well made this film was, the score and cinematography is both haunting and dreamlike, giving the viewer an unsettling experience. The story in Get Out, is well realized and the trailer doesn't do enough justice, this isn't a white vs. black film, but rather a social commentary on marginalization, that uses the current events in our world as a springboard to get its ideas across. There were themes/metaphors throughout the film that I didn't realize were connected until the movie was over, this is far more than your average scary movie. Though you can treat it like a good ole' popcorn flick, the film has enough depth to keep the most sharp-eyed viewer thinking afterwards.

With that aside, Get Out is an almost perfect example of a horror/comedy mix, the use of LilRel Howery as the comic relief was excellent, his moments were scattered throughout the film but they never felt out of place and he was actually genuinely funny. This film felt like an old episode of goosebumps or a live action version of the board game ""Clue"", due to the mystery the protagonist faces. As he is discovering what is going so is the audience and though I was able to piece together what was happening early on, I was still enthralled with what was going on, due to the excellent writing and performances. Most of the actors and actresses in this film were unknown to me but all of them played their roles convincingly well, particularly Caleb Landry Jones, who had a riveting scene that takes place at a dinner table which really got under my skin.

Overall this is a well crafted film that had me on the edge of seat, Jordan Peele proves that he is not just a funny guy but should be taken seriously as writer and director. I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Get Out and do highly recommend it. I see myself re-watching this film quite a few times, especially around the Halloween season, as it just has a fall vibe to it. This really is one of my favourite movies I've seen so far this year, so for that reason, I'm giving Get Out an 8.5/10."
276,"8/10 | Several things to like about this one. 1. How it approached a sensitive subject was both directly honest and at times unexpectedly (by viewer, but of course by design) funny. 2. Actors well chosen and their performances almost too real to the point of weird- scary. You just don't know what secretly lurks behind those smiles. 3. You know something is not quite right and the writer/director did a nice job of building into ""how-not-right-it-was"". 4. Rod our TSA agent, and friend to Chris, our lead protagonist, was a highlight bonus, offering a humorous perspective (a role where usually the confidant ends up being either clueless, incompetent, or dead) . Check out his end-of-film worldly advices (sp) to Chris in special features. 5. I preferred the ending that our director chose vs. the alternate ending as it was consistent with Chris's intelligence and personality.

277,"8/10 | Get Out follows a young black man as he goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents. From there, weirder and weirder things begin to take place.

To start, the acting is pretty solid. Daniel Kaluuya as the leading character paints himself as something of the modern 20-something- year-old. He's relatable, he's mostly interesting, he's got his flaws and he's got his perks. And he's a photographer. Gotta appeal to the hipster crowd too. In all seriousness his character is very realistically played, but even more so when he needs to hit an emotional high note this guy nails it. Starring alongside him is Allison Williams whom I believe said that this was her first movie. Seeing her on screen that's not something you'd think. She's so subtle and so well played, even if she is a little dull from time to time. You can tell that's part of her character, that's what she's going for and it actually works really well. The performances of the two parents, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, are great as well. I'm going to sound like a broken record here but again, subtlety, they got it. In a film of overwhelming mystery, the subtlety here plays a key role and works fantastically from start to finish.

But what are good actors without a good screenplay? The writing is quite good. While a few lines came off as forced or awkward, the vast majority of it works very well, and the way the story progresses is engaging and very mysterious. It never really hints at what the end goal may be, and yet it makes sense when it's finally revealed. There's no 'eureka!' moment when the twist is revealed, yet that may be the very reason it worked so well. Because once again, subtlety.

Probably the biggest star of this film is Jordan Peele, the director. It's hard to believe that this is the first time he's made a full length film. His ability to direct is fantastic. The way it's shot is that of a professional, and I look forward to seeing more of his filmmaking career in the near future.

Most horror movies feature generic music cues and sharp, loud sound effects to keep the viewer awake through it's entirely boring scare tactics, and while Get Out does use those same sound effects, they are woven into actual music that is quite good. And I get the feeling that the music was partially used to satire typical horror movies, considering how unique this one is compared to others. And while it may come off of as generic or lazy to 'cue the creepy music when creepy stuff happens', the music is still good and, upon a second watch, actually justified.

While I enjoyed Get Out for the most part both times I saw it, that's probably my biggest problem with it. The first time I saw it I didn't care at all. The build up seemed to be going nowhere, and it was all just so weird. However, when the twist ending rolled around I suddenly understood and enjoyed it much more. Upon a rewatch I was able to pick up on the things I missed, along with some unexpected comedic foreshadowing. And while some of the comedy did work, some of it didn't. Unlike the trailer made it seem, the movie is hardly a satire on modern horror, or even a comedy to begin with. It's very much a mystery, so don't go into it expecting to laugh.

Overall I really enjoyed Get Out. The acting, writing, and story are good, and the soundtrack is effectively used. It's a subtle mystery that hits more high notes than low ones. It's one that I can certainly see myself returning to time and time again to see and pick up on new things. In the end I'd definitely recommend it, but moreover, I'd recommend seeing it more than once."

279,"8/10 | Get Out (2017):

Satirical Horror on most controversial issue of America.Jordan Peele,debutante director chose such sensitive and rare subject and moulded it into a great film which got great critical and commercial success (Which is completely rare for a horror film).I always look out for non typical horror films which has something new in it.So how is the movie?

Plot:

Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend Rose (Uyir Piriyum Valiyai) go upstate to visit her parent's for the weekend. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.

Plus Points:

1)Story Screenplay and Direction: Jordan Peele really deserves an applause for making such a dare attempt.Movies on racism issues are not new in Hollwyood but Jordan Peele achieved an unthinkable feat.Without using typical jump scares Peele utilizing a queasy atmosphere of dread and a terrifically choreographed escalation of suspense and crowd-pleasing thrills.

2)Cinematography: Toby Oliver's terrific cinematography successfully brought the necessary eerie feel to the movie.The Sunken Place,an area at which Chris goes in hypnotized phase is a stunning shot.

3)BGM: Newcomer Michael Abels's BGM is pitch perfect as it even gives a subtle hint of mocking other horror's background scores.

4)Performances: Daniel Kaluuya, who impresses with a charismatic performance that should ultimately be seen as his breakout leading role. Constantly making you question anything and everything that is going on are Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener, who use their innate affability to make you question every move they make. Deserving of special attention, though, is Lil Rel Howery, who plays Chris' best friend and contact in the outside world and steals every single scene he's in.

So,Get Out is a much needed refreshing breeze for a new age of horror film.Most innovative horror since It Follows.

My Rating 7.75/10"
280,"8/10 | I recently watched this movie again with my girlfriend who hasn't seen it and I have to retract my original opinion. I think I was in a bad mood when I first saw it in theatres and blasted it, but now seeing it for the second time it's a very original intense thriller turned horror by the end. My only big knock on this movie is that within the first 25 mins or so I already had figured out what was happening, not to the extent that it goes to, but it was predictable. It's worth a watch.

281,"10/10 | This movie is unexpected and unpredictable - think Twighlight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock, My Mother the Serial Killer, Stepford Wives, The Lottery - put them all in a blender with great actors and spooky music and it comes close to describing this film. Jordan Peele slices through political correctness like a neurosurgeon. You end up hating the characters you liked and liking the TSA! Nothing ends up the way you expect. Heading in one direction, you think you have it figured out and all of a sudden, you take a proverbial left turn off a cliff (with a stupid brother playing banjo) and things are not what they seem. Pacing, timing cinematography, lighting, music all combine to keep things tight and focused. Funny moments but this isn't a comedy. You will leave the movie theater thinking more deeply and seeing more clearly and wanting to see the movie again! (But you may never drink a cup of tea again!)

285,"8/10 | I was fortunate enough to watch this without watching any of the trailers or having any prior knowledge of it beforehand. It was a thrilling ride! However I would say that the trailer retrospectively gives too much away. It is very clever and I love how it drip feeds you tiny bits of information. Dare I say, one of my favourite movies of all time!

286,"9/10 | A terrific blend of horror & dark comedy that interweaves its ingeniously layered narrative with timely social commentary to deliver a nail-biting experience that's accomplished on all scales, Get Out is a smart, subversive & sardonic delight that's neither overt nor covert, and offers a cinematic ride so effective, thrilling & entertaining that the fact that it is actually a directorial debut makes it all the more commendable.

287,"8/10 | The warning comes early on in Get Out, comedian Jordan Peele's deliciously unsettling horror and directorial debut. As successful New York photographer Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) phones his best friend Rod (a hilarious LilRel Howery) to break the news that he is to meet his white girlfriend's middle-class parents at their countryside home, Rod immediately voices his concerns. He is adamant that there is bound to be some weird, sex-slave s**t going down, but Chris laughs it off with no idea with what is in store for him. In years to come, I have no doubt that Get Out will be a key case study in trying to understand the racial minefield that is modern America. While many have convinced themselves that such medieval attitudes are now behind them, it's quite clear that tensions are as high as ever in the #BackLivesMatter, post-Obama world we live in.

On their journey, Chris and his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) hit a deer. When being questioned by the police, the white officer can't resist giving Chris a hard time, even though he wasn't the one driving. He receives a telling-off from Rose, but the tone is set. Chris shrugs it off because he is no doubt used to it. Upon arriving at the impressive home of the potentially future in-laws, father and neurosurgeon Dean (Bradley Whitford) insists they are 'huggers', and appears to embrace Chris. He nonetheless lets slip opinions about wiping out the race of pesky deer who roam their land and voices his frustration at his own father missing out on the Olympic Games due to Jesse Owens, but again this is nothing Chris hasn't seen before from middle-class, white Obama-voters. Rose's mother Missy (Catherine Keener) is more steely, but is a trained hypnotist and offers to help Chris rid himself of his nicotine addiction. So far, so uncomfortable, but things soon get seriously weird.

For such apparently racially-blind liberals, their household staff are all black. Not only that, but they are like dead-eyed robots, all smiles and pleasantries masking pleading and inner turmoil. When Chris tries to bond with groundskeeper and fellow brother Walter (Marcus Henderson), the conversation is awkward and stiff, and maid Georgina (the brilliant Betty Gabriel) seems to do little during her off- hours but stare at herself in the mirror. At a gathering at their home, the only black face in the large crowd seems unnervingly familiar, but he is dressed up like a trophy pet by his fat, much older white wife. When Missy finally gets Chris to sit down for a session and open up about the death of his mother, his worst fears are truly realised. Taking inspiration from, of all films, Being John Malkovich (which also starred Keener), Peele directs these moments with the eye of a horror maestro, proving to be truly uncomfortable, claustrophobic viewing.

Get Out wears its heart on its sleeve, with an almost complete disregard for subtlety. However, this works in the film's favour. It's hugely entertaining and frequently very funny, so it will appeal to just about any audience, reaching more people in the process. Word-of-mouth has already gotten around, so the message is clearly resonating. It's sharp and unique in a way that modern horror movies rarely are, and in no way feels like an elongated sketch from the Key and Peele TV show. Although I've seen relatively little of his work outside of sketches on YouTube and his appearance with Keegan- Michael Key in season 1 of Fargo, there is nothing in his previous output to suggest he was capable of crafting such an intelligent and engaging horror movie. Satirically savvy and edgy, Get Out is also creepy and thoughtful, proving that a black man alone in the white suburbs is just as terrifying as a pretty white girl lost in the woods."
288,"9/10 | Jordan Peele's screen writing/directorial debut is quite the leap, exchanging the comedic chops one might expect for a potent blend of social commentary, suspense and horror. Peele shows us a creepy upper-class suburban atmosphere, host to a mixed-race couple's ""meet the parents"" moment, with a thick, permeating air of uncertainty and alarm. Everyone seems overly accepting of Chris, hometown girl Rose's new black boyfriend, but there's a look to their gaze that might imply something else. The town's dark-skinned residents, however, are less reserved. They behave like marionettes, Stepford Wives with an unnervingly wide smile: stiff, oddly-dressed and thoroughly disconcerting in posture and prose. At first glance, I worried that the metaphors Peele was searching for would be too on-the-nose and blunt, but his well paced, muti-layered story soon brushes those concerns away. The analogies remain, but they're nuanced and subtle, effective players in a larger tapestry. The greater story is twisting and unpredictable, a mystery that efficiently mixes legitimate worries with tension-breaking laughs and personal connections to throw us off the scent. We don't know who's in on the scheme (or what that scheme might be) until the very end, and for too long Chris is afraid to point fingers, lest he offend. Balancing social niceties with the increasing terror makes a great vehicle for this genre, and the prim-and-proper atmosphere only makes the occasional weird offhand remark or personal tick stick out that much more. An excellent small-scale nail-biter, it's richly crafted and sharp, with a sensitive finger right on the cultural pulse. Well worth the hype."
289,"9/10 | With a title as Get Out I was expecting a bloody horror movie but it isn't that kind of movie. I would not call it a real horror movie though, more a mystery thriller. The mystery part is clearly the best part of the movie and luckily for us the mystery last almost the entire movie. It all starts nicely but the more you get into the movie the more it gets creepy. There's clearly something bad going on, but they don't reveal everything at once and that's a real positive thing in this movie. The suspense building is slow but once you're into it you won't get out of it. Daniel Kaluuya plays the major character and he did a great job. The rest of the cast was also good and they all contribute to make this movie better than the rest in this genre. To me the best part of the movie is the middle of the movie where you wonder what the hell is happening. One of the better movies in this genre that I saw this year.

290,"9/10 | People are way overthinking this movie. It's not a social/political satire. It's not racist. Yes, it does make fun of white racist stereotypes of black people, but nobody in their right mind would think the writer/director actually thinks most white people think like the mad scientists in this film do. This is a basic thriller, a piece of old-fashioned movie-making. It is inspired by the classic ""The Stepford Wives"" which did something similar with sexism as this film does with racism.

The plot involves a young black man who is taken by his girlfriend to visit her parents for the weekend. The family has black servants who act weird. Although the plot unfolds in a somewhat predictable way, the movie is elevated by intriguing parallels that involve the main character's childhood trauma. The mom is a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis, and being a hypnotherapist myself I can say that although these scenes exaggerate the power of hypnosis, they don't exaggerate it by much.

There are a few surprises, but what I liked best about this movie is the strange recurring motif that involves the main character's trauma. We see his weakness but also his strength. That made this film a cut above standard horror/thriller movies.

By the way this movie is not very violent; it's about average for a suspense movie. If you want a slasher movie with a lot of blood and gore this isn't it. It's a thinking person's movie."
291,"9/10 | Get Out is a combination of a comedy and a horror, but it certainly isn't your average horror-comedy hybrid. It is one that makes a daunting achievement of not only evenly balancing laughs with a grim tone, but providing a fascinatingly unique examination on racism, an issue that is overwhelmingly relative in our society today. There are gut-busting laughs, there are some dark moments, and are even some scenes of gore. But above these components is an intelligent, yet bizarre allegory of the African-American community falling victim to racial prejudice among a society where racism has run rampant. The mastermind behind this treat is Jordan Peele, the sketch comedic star fresh from Comedy Central's 'Key and Peele' and taking the seat in his directorial debut. With a blend of vulgar humor and gags centered on racial stereotypes, Peele's comedic flair definitely bleeds through. This film focuses on Chris Washington (played by Daniel Kaluuya), a twenty-something year old African- American man who sets out to spend the weekend with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (played by Allison Williams) at her parents' house. Upon meeting her parents (played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) for the first time, Chris quickly begins to witness some strange behavior among the family including relatives and their house maid Georgina (played by Betty Gabriel) who happens to African-American. This leads to one major conclusion: something is not about this family.

It is significantly rare that directors successfully pull off an congruent balance of outrageous laughter and spine-chilling scares, let alone splicing smart social commentary on racial prejudice. Jordan Peele manages to hit that note in nearly every way possible to the point where there is never a dull moment. The film spends the first half showcasing the paranoia of the lead character's uncomfortable situation including calm interactions with his girlfriend's family that quickly morph into awkward circumstances. Throughout the time, Peele does a tremendous job at breathing suspense into the atmosphere that viewers feeling off-kilter and questioning what on Earth is happening around the lead character and what the characters are thinking about the lead character being colored skin and dating a white female. In turn of satirizing the subject matter, the film does so by providing witty social commentary about the African-American stereotypes rather than being going the obvious route by preaching about racial bigotry. Along the way, there is more than a handful of laughs to be offered, most of which come from the lead character's best friend played by LilRel Howery who spends most of the time away from the chaos. It is not until the final half-hour however, when the film escalates into a gory and unnerving fiasco, challenging viewers' expectations upon every turn. While the ending does not the strike a chord in the surprise department, Peele never fails to defy against uniformity nor does slap viewers in the face with his political message.

Get Out is an entertaining, audacious, and surprisingly brainy horror-comedy that not only showcases Jordan Peele's unexpected directorial talent, but opens the door to an outrageous fun, yet bizarre good time. Marking this film as cinematic gold for both the comedy and horror genre may be saying a lot. At the same time, it wouldn't be too unreasonable, especially as no Hollywood director has a made a more daring comedic endeavor such a long time."

295,"8/10 | This is a very clever movie, however I am not sure that I would call it horror, it more like a thriller.

I am not going to give anything away, all I have to say is that the movie keeps you engaged right the way through. As a viewer you know that something is not right but you cant out your finger on it and for me when the secret was finally revealed it certainly was not what I was thinking.

In terms of time the movie is just the right length, that's one of the reasons why the movie works so well. From an acting front, there is no one standout actor but ideal for the characters they play.

So go right ahead watch the movie and prepare to GET OUT!

298,"8/10 | I have to be honest with you: when I first saw how good approval this movie had got I immediately thought that must be due to both actor and producer being black. I was wrong. Get Out is one the best horror movies in the last decade standing alongside with It Follows and The Babadook who have got over eighty Metascore rating as well which is very rare for a horror movie to have.

So we are following an interracial couple visiting her rich (white) parents. Chris (her boyfriend) is a photographer and a very down-to-earth guy who may feel, well, a bit awkward surrounded by a bunch of rich white people. From the moment they arrive things look kinda shady. Nothing in particular prone to much suspect, but that gut feeling tells you that this family, least said, might not be the healthiest one. Creating this quaint ambient is what Get Out does the best. Not only that, but Jordan Peele even managed to fully utilize this mystery elements by creating few very eerie and unpredictable plot twists.

Story itself isn't much of a big deal but does what is supposed to do: it creeps slowly and bursts formidably. Hence, Get Out is not fast paced (like Green Room) but rather makes you think about what is going on here. Different relationship which characters form with each other are worth noticing too. It is truly formidable to have people who you trust turn their back on you in most terrible way. Chris is experiencing snippets of this all the time but may as well think he is the problem. Just wait till you see the grand finale with this aspect!

It is always dangerous to combine serious horror/mystery/thriller with humor because it might create a conflict between these two contrary sides. Get Out breaks the ""monotony of tension"" by introducing a character who doesn't occupy much time not undermines basic genre and manages to somehow ""reset"" the atmosphere by breaking it with humor; the mystery side then takes the lead and begins to glue the atmosphere back together, this time even stronger until everything bursts due to pressure.

We've seen some basic mechanism which Peele utilized so let me immediately conclude. Get Out is a serious candidate for the best horror movie of the last decade or so. All the elements stick together because there is a strong atmosphere which serves as a glue. It is scary and funny. Get out of here and see it!"
299,"8/10 | Although I can safely say that I can watch anything except ""HORROR"". A genre I avoid at all costs. But then came ""Get Out"" and the buzz was so high that it was really difficult to let it pass.

And let me say that how wrong i was and how beautiful the movie was. The premise is an age old tale, but it is not what you say but the way say it is important.it makes a movie good or bad for me.

This movie really have a strong script, good actors and the net result is amazing.

I would recommend everyone to watch it.

302,"9/10 | A near master class in tonal balance. Every scene can be viewed through a lens of either horror or comedy and it works; this is truly exceptional. A great reactionary performance from Daniel Kaluuya, full of responsive eye twitches and half-smirks that speak volumes.

The social satire cuts deep, especially in its revelation of a white liberal racism outside the stereotypical redneck variety, but the film relents a bit in the final act. Same goes for the horror elements; the finale is a bit of a stretch (even if it is fittingly cathartic) and the movie doesn't reach for the extreme hard enough to justify its more out- there elements (Behold the Coagula). It kind of falls awkwardly in the middle; a half measure.

305,"9/10 | I can now see why this psychological horror is so mind-bending. After catching this movie, I have to say that this is a thrill ride that continuously toyed with my perspective up until the terrible truth is unveiled midway into the film.

Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), a black man with a hobby in photography has a white girlfriend named Rose that live happily together in the city. When she then decides to finally introduce him to her parents in her hometown outside the city, they seem to welcome him in open arms. However, the townsfolk begin to show signs of odd behavior whenever Chris so much as approaches any of them or if he even speaks his mind in conversations. Chris becomes increasingly paranoid as he uncovers more to the town than meets the eye.

For comedian Jordan Peele's directorial debut in a horror film and his pairing with ""Paranormal Activity"" producer Jason Blum, this is something that required more thought as the story began to play out. I honestly attempted to comprehend the motives of each character, but as I started deducing their reasons, it grows unsettling each time. Instead of racism being used as a plot device, it seems this is a bizarre twist on that subject matter by making the residence not racist, yet they add insult to injury in their true nature by giving off a form of liberal ignorance. There are moments in the film that were pretty laughable to ease the tension done by the leading man's best friend TSA Officer Rod (played by comic Lil Rel Howery). And I say this doesn't ruin the ride, more like only gives depth into what his character knows what's best for himself and his friend. In the end, this isn't a movie made for cheap jumps or thrills. Instead, it kept the gears in my mind constantly turning and my curiosity growing with how the horror conventions were approached differently here. It's certainly interesting."

309,"10/10 | You could predict the quality – or at least freshness – from the trailers but nothing will quite prepare you for this joyride which is a contender for the best horror movie of recent times, and crafty enough to satisfy also those who don't really care about horror movies. Such as me.

Brother (Daniel Kaluuya) dating a white girl (Allison Williams) is dragged to her family estate for the weekend. But something is off from the very start of the journey, and it gets stranger by the minute.

There's a variety of cool cats in smaller supporting roles and you will probably not know them by name, but I will list them anyway: Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener as the mother and father, Caleb Landry Jones as the brother, Betty Gabriel as the house maid, LilRel Howery as one of the funniest cases of black guy acting like Hollywood comedy black guy I can remember.

IMDb claims he is a rising stand-up comedy star, and he's surely an instant crowd-pleaser here. You will love every precious minute the guy gets to grace the screen.

But back to the movie at hand. Get Out"" is an effective horror piece but director-screenwriter Jordan Peele's ambitions are decidedly wider than that, and he can meet the high standards that he has set.

If I have to to summarize his biggest accomplishment, then I would say that Peele proves to be a master storyteller.

There's a surprising diversity and depth to material. It can be followed as social commentary (what it's like to be different; how covertly racist the modern society can be), classic horror story (adventurer braving the lands unknown) and a crafty cat-and-mouse thriller where the joy of watching rises from following how every ""chess piece"" is moved and how the others react.

In addition, there's an unexpected comic relief going on, mainly acted out by LilRey Howrey as mentioned above. And last but not least, the movie makers have really taken their time with the characters and the setting to build an natural, convincing atmosphere which can stand on its own and doesn't have to rely on cheap horror tactics as sudden horrifying noises and movements.

Peele actually uses some of those too, but in a way that doesn't feel exploitative; these help to strenghten the oppressive atmosphere and further show how the main character feels.

If I may nitpick a little, the central hero deserves to have some more individuality because he mostly gets to react to awkward and/or unpleasant situations like in black version of Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or something. This one-note-performance by Kaluuya honestly gets a bit monotone before the action-filled final act.

But all in all, the chosen approach is understandable because Get Out"" is only 103 minutes long and has a lot happening. And to credit the cast one more time, everybody's offering a top-quality work, even the people in smallest roles.

Considering how much their faces are shown up-close, it's no mean feat. I'd even call it one of the most memorable ensemble movies of recent times.

There are also some pacing issues, mostly during the end which would be more hard-hitting if played out faster, especially as some major turns are not that hard to figure out by the middle.

Of course, that would require attentive watching and not checking your phone all the time, as many youngsters do these days. Also, horror fans would probably like to see more gore but this is not a problem in itself. So the movie's not near perfect but what is, eh?

Get Out"" is that rare kind of horror movie that really deserves some major-ass awards or nominations. Maybe Oscar noms for original screenplay, directing, and several possible picks from supporting cast (Betty Gabriel, Bradley Whitford, LilRel Howery if I can pick three).

If you liked this little gem that deserves to be called born classic, then you will be pleased to know that it's been already popular in cinemas. It only cost 4.5 million USD and has already brought 113 mil from the U.S. box office alone.

""Get Out"" is the best movie of 2017 I've seen yet. And I have seen ten! Get off your ass and run towards the cinemas!"
310,"9/10 | The opening scene of ""Get Out"" (2017 release; 103 min.) shows a black guy being abducted and thrown into the back of a car as he was talking at night in an unspecified suburb. We have no clue what is going on. After the opening title, we get to know Rose and Chris, an interracial couple . They are getting ready for a weekend visit to Rose's parents, who have no idea that Chris is African-American, but Rose insists all will be fine. On the drive up, when their car is hit by a deer, the cop asks Chris for identification, even though he wasn't driving. Rose takes offense at the seeming racial profiling. Finally Rose and Chris arrive at her parent's place, a suburban McMansion, and receive a warm welcome. At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is a labor of love from actor-writer-producer-director Jordan Peele, making his directorial debut. Peele, best known for comedy, goes into a vastly different direction, presenting a clever and original 'horror' story for the thinking person. If you are expecting a 'slasher' horror movie, the likes of which are all too common these days in the horror genre, you will be disappointed (or relieved, depending on your viewpoint). Instead, the story focuses on an increasingly discomforting situation where a black man gets introduced to a white family (and circle of friends), who ""would've voted for Obama a third time, if I had the chance"". British actor Daniel Kaluuya, whom we most recently saw in the outstanding ""Sicario"", is even better in this lead role, playing the cool-as-cucumber Chris, until things aren't cool anymore (mustn't say more--biting my tongue here!). But the big star, even though he never appears on the screen, is of course Jordan Peele, who shows enormous promise in his directorial debut. Working on a (for Hollywood) microscopic budget of a mere $4.5 million, Peele gives us an accomplished 'horror' movie where less is more. Can't wait to see what Peele will do next, but whatever it is, I'm all in!

""Get Out"" opened wide some weeks ago to immediate critical and commercial acclaim. This movie may well become the biggest financial success (as in: return on investment) of the year (rapidly approaching $150 mill. at the box office in North America). The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati this weekend was PACKED and sold out to the very last seat, quite unusual for a movie that's been playing already for weeks. But the positive buzz and correlating word-of-mouth surrounding this movie are absolutely merited. Even if you're not a fan of the horror film genre (like me), I encourage you to seek this out, be it in the theater, later on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Get Out' is, in every which way, a WINNER."

312,"8/10 | Get Out, is the director debut for Jordan Peele, and he did a fantastic job, this movie is suspenseful, and well done. The comedy landed well especially the character Rod. This is one of the rare new stand alone horror films where I remember most of the characters names. I loved it, its trippy, and scary without the need of jump scares many times. The scary part was its atmosphere. This was well made and I look forward to the next few movies with the same crew in a few years.

314,"8/10 | I came to IMDB after watching Get Out, and I was excited to see what everyone else thought of this fantastic movie.

You can imagine my disappointment to find more than a fair share of cries of racism, and the despicable, repeated and ironically racist notion that if this movie had a white director, it would not have received the same praise.

The reality is that this movie is brilliant and horrifying. Absolutely unbelievable work for the first-time director Jordan Peele. I love horror films, but I've become jaded and found it hard to feel anything resembling terror from anything released in the past few years.

This movie is terrifying. Terrifying in a way that keeps you begging to know more even once the credits roll. 10/10

315,"8/10 | The first two acts of 'Get Out (2017)' are fantastic, creating a palpable sense of growing unease and mounting dread. The film does come to somewhat of a halt as it approaches its final third, with one scene too many spent away from our protagonist. It's fortunate, then, that the explosive finale brings the story to a satisfying conclusion. All the tension culminates in a brutal final confrontation that isn't afraid to go dark, finally releasing all that expertly built tension and becoming an incredibly crowd-pleasing but still gruelling experience. It's a very smart and subversive film, one that manages to plant the seeds for almost every aspect of its plot perfectly and tie the perspective of its protagonist into its narrative in an incredibly intrinsic way. It satisfyingly subverts the tropes of the genre while still hitting all the beats required to make it recognisable to a wide audience. On a second viewing, it is easy to forget just how strange and unexpected the picture truly is. It is honestly one of the most surprising pieces I've seen in some time, with each twist somehow seeming wholly natural yet entirely out of left field. The movie also has some incredible writing and several fully formed characters that are among the best of their kind. Special mention must be made of Daniel Kaluuya, who deserves all the praise and awards coming his way as he delivers what is, for me, perhaps the best performance of the year. The picture represents remarkable film-making in every sense and is definitely one of the absolute best horror films I've ever seen. 9/10"
316,"8/10 | The amiable Daniel Kaluuya gives an enjoyable breakthrough performance as Chris Washington, a young black artist dating white girl Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). Five months into the relationship, and it's time to meet her parents. They live in a back of the beyond universe populated almost exclusively by whites, along with a few black people who behave quite strangely. Chris will discover some nefarious doings by Roses' mom and pop (Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford) and these other members of the white elite. Will he be able to ""get out"" of this situation before it's too late?

Overall, the filmmaking debut for sketch comedian Jordan Peele is a respectable, if not great, effort to blend some commentary on racial relations with a tried and true, formulaic Hollywood thriller. This viewer could point out the film that seems to have inspired Peele the most, but that would be along the lines of a spoiler. While the film is technically well made and well paced, and builds towards an appropriately visceral finale, it is troubling in some ways. Its ""mystery"" is easy to figure out (Hell, Chris' seemingly paranoid friend Rod (LilRel Howery) may actually be on to something), and the characters are pretty ""black and white"", if you'll pardon the expression. Undoubtedly, the film is perfect at being manipulative, with villains whose violent comeuppance is the ultimate catharsis.

The cast provides most of the value. Williams is good as the girlfriend who, at first, tries to have you wondering ""is she or isn't she"". Old pros like Keener, Whitford, Stephen Root, and Richard Herd do as much as they can with cliched roles. The lively and profane Howery is quite amusing. Caleb Landry Jones dials up the seediness to 11 in his role as Roses' loutish brother Jeremy.

As this viewer said, the scenario is likely to get the blood of some audience members boiling, but it could have used a bit more restraint. It's certainly entertaining to a degree, and clearly it did hit a nerve with the movie-going public, even garnering some Oscar nominations.

Six out of 10."
317,"7/10 | Jordan Peele's debut has changed the game. A sharp, visceral and at some points comedic look at 'modern racism' in america is just what cinema needed.

Social thrillers now have standards set far higher than any predecessor due to outstanding performances by Daniel kaluuya and Allison williams and a captivating story line with a perfect plot twist.

What prevents this thriller from reaching the heights of nolans is the unfortunate unrealistic concept of brain transfers which frustratingly holds back this film from becoming a masterpiece.

Despite that the symbols and motifs lift this film well beyond classic thrillers and has engraved itself in the history of cinema

318,"8/10 | This is one of those movies that grips you and doesnt let go until the end. There is some excellent humor in it too, but it never goes against the mood of the film, it builds on it and this is the first time I actually saw a movie who was a serious psychological triller, but which got a few good laughs out of me!

The actors are all well casted and main role dude did an excellent job, hope to see him in more movies too.

I recommend it to anyone loving excellent films, especially to those of us who love a good psychological thriller.

319,"7/10 | The only thing I'd known before walking into ""Get Out"" (aside from the hype) is that it somehow mixes racial politics and horror. And really, that alone is enough to get the curiosity piqued, but it's the mechanics of the thing that makes it so entertaining. The *how*.

Jordan Peele kicks things off with a certain sense of foreboding; that a potentially awkward meeting-her-parents getaway has sinister intent. Nothing is what it seems, and that uncertainty makes the viewer uncomfortable (in my case, at least). Dread builds on itself until Peele finally pulls out the rug with a classic horror twist; from there, it's a solid thrill ride til the very end.

I liked everything about this movie; the excellent cast, the sharp writing, the tense subject matter. Even the comedic side character is ideal But I loved that I had no idea where all of this was going.

It's scary as hell and a lot of fun.

8/10"
320,"9/10 | Multi-talented Jordan Peele both write and directed this controversial thriller that is likely to win awards in many categories. Not only has he selected a superb cast, but he also is willing to take the racial conflict where few have dared go - a story where the concept of being Black in a white atmosphere changes from being an advantage, a showcase for Black culture, to a nightmare of racism carried to the extreme.

The film opens strangely with an incident on the street of an apparent kidnapping of a black young man (LaKeith Stanfield). Jump some time later when Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young Black photographer, visits Rose (Allison Williams), his white girlfriend's family estate, he becomes ensnared in the more sinister, real reason for the invitation. The parents (psychiatrist Missy - Catherine Keener and neurosurgeon Dean - Bradley Whitford) are strange but apparently conspicuously non-racist. At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he could have never imagined. The manner in which the Black 'help' - Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel) - interact with Chris is bizarre, as is the presence of some of the guests at a party held in the estate at night. Where it leads must be seen - otherwise the mood and story are spoiled.

Unique story, well written and directed and photographed and acted, this is a fine film that makes many necessary observations."
321,"10/10 | This film could be categorized as a horror film, or a satire. It has elements of both, although the Golden Globes nominating it in the ""Comedy/Musical"" category is a stretch.

Much has already been said about the film by critics and in other IMDb reviews. A film like this is only as good as the performances, and they are incredible. The entire cast must've realized what an original piece this is, merging elements from home invasion movies like The Purge with social comedies like Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. If you are familiar with the careers of Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener, you will be knocked out by what they do in this film. Allison Williams, daughter of Brian (those cheekbones give that away...), is also downright surprising here.

Perhaps the Golden Globes placed this film in the Comedy/Musical category since there were so many fine dramas to come out in 2017. We can only be as lucky with movies next year..."
322,"9/10 | In 2017, Jordan Peele proved he's not a one-trick pony when it comes to his career. When not playing all kinds of various characters on his Comedy Central series 'Key & Peele,' he lately has starred in mostly lower-tiered comedy movies. Then came 'Get Out' - Universal and Blumhouse's terrifying psychological thriller that was written and directed by Peele. The film follows the story of a young couple who happen to be mixed race (Daniel Kaluuya as ""Chris"" and Allison Williams as ""Rose"") who take a weekend trip to visit her parents' estate in the country.

What's expected about 'Get Out' is the major emphasis on race, as Rose's family (and extended family) is virtually entirely white, and their two hired support staff, Georgina and Walter (Betty Gabriel and Marcus Henderson), are black. As Chris begins to learn more about his girlfriend's family as he spends more time with them, he realizes things are not exactly what meets the eye. While some films mishandle the issue of race relations, 'Get Out' is written in a way that seems fair and doesn't spend too much time on stereotypes. But make no mistake - there is a lot more at play than race in this film.

The themes of guilt and regret have a central role in 'Get Out,' including references to characters' pasts (especially with regard to Chris and his upbringing). What helps these feel authentic is the excellent character development and acting performances, not only by newcomers Kaluuya and Williams, but veteran actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are standouts as Rose's parents. They are complicated individuals and things become clearer as the film progresses, but they never lose their edge as we drift into ""the sunken place."" And then there's LilRel Howery, who portrays Chris' TSA agent friend Rod Williams. Rod's character is definitely the film's attempt at comic relief - and for the most part, he delivers without making things seem too cheesy or out of place.

The only issue with 'Get Out' is the final third of the film, which seems to follow a typical formula. Despite the adrenaline rush that results, there are flashes of a ""seen it before"" feeling in some of the final moments. Even so, this does not really take away from the overall effort.

Based on the runaway success of 'Get Out,' it's likely Jordan Peele has a future in directing and writing rather than just offering up laughs."
323,"8/10 | GET OUT directed by Jordan Peele is like no other film that I have ever seen; not a conventional comedy, nor a conventional horror movie - but rather a trenchant psychological thriller about black/white relations incorporating myth, history, and racial symbolism resulting in an intelligent, profoundly moving fable. GET OUT opens with an abduction of an innocent young black man who is lost, aimlessly searching for an address on a quiet suburban street in the dark of night - this one abbreviated cinematic moment encapsulates years of racial violence, forecasting what lies ahead for the viewer.

We witness a young couple who appear to be disarmingly happy - a young African American man Chris Washington (an excellent Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (a lovely Allison Williams) packing in preparation for a visit to her parent's home in the suburbs. Once they are in the car leaving the city they allegorically cross a ""color line"" and the mystery and tension mounts with baleful incidents that augur a grim future.

When they arrive at their destination, we observe in the behavior towards Chris, a cool veneer that is draped over each character like a shroud of duplicity, particular Rose's ""liberal"" parents (the wonderful Catherine Keener as her mother Missy) along with a groups of friends who are invited to an annual lawn party. Each character is satirically delineated with a familiarity that betrays their inner bigotry. GET OUT is so biting that the ensuing marks claw deeply under our skins.

Jordan Peele (formerly of Key and Peele) in his directorial debut makes memorable use of his powerful comedic skill, but this time we do not laugh with joy, but we drown in the despair of a modern-day allegory of stereotypical attitudes and conspiratorial stratagems towards Afro-Americans that are as original and devastating as a science-fiction tale."

325,"9/10 | I've seen mixed reviews about this movie. Some people loved it while others consider it to display an extreme standpoint of systematic racism. To me, its a well-made horror movie with subtle comedic moments. The perspective, although exaggerated and unrealistic, is fresh and unique. Its a break from typical horror movies and there are great symbolic references through the visuals, dialogue and soundtrack. There is great depth to the scenes and I realized this after reading the IMDb trivia section (avoid it if you haven't watched the movie yet). The plot was quite predictable but I was impressed by the way it was executed. The dialogue contains great meaning and provides us an insight into the stereotypes that human beings have to live with everyday. And lastly, it was refreshing to see the black guy actually surviving till the end of a horror movie.

The story is so unique, the build up is so in place, there is not a moment of cringe horror acting, the characters all act logicaly like anybody would act in that kind of a situation, especially the main character. I don't know who he is, but from now on, he is in my top 10 actors, altho this is the only movie I've watched him in. Throughout the whole movie, there is this feeling of creepiness and tension which leaves you at the edge of your seat, especially at the end where you get to know and understand it all. It is not a horror, it is not a thriller, it is not a mistery, it is everything combined, but none of these alone. I don't know , maybe the director invented a new genre.

336,"1/10 | Personally I liked the movie ""Get Out"". The plot of the film has an exciting process that never lets the groom know what's going to happen next. In the film, the director has the shots and angles well thought over. Most scenes have a special transition, which provides the viewer with a better insight into the film. The tension of the film increases over time, which ensures that you wanna know what happen next. I think the normal end of the film is unexpected and not very realistic, which made me think about it later on the film. The other variant of the end, I liked better, although it is a sadder end. In both scenes there was help at the last moment, all the people who survived were the same as in the other scene. A good movie for people who want to have a good tension of a movie

344,"1/10 | STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning

Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) are a mixed race couple, who are travelling to meet Rose's parents, Missy (Catherine Keener) and Dean (Bradley Whitford), a retired neuro-surgeon, for the weekend. While they seem fairly nice, Chris can't help but pick up loads of subtle little knocks at his African American heritage (most notably, learning Dean's grandfather was robbed of his dream at the 1936 Olympics by Jesse Owens.) One night, Missy puts Chris under a teacup induced hypnotic trance, and from there he finds himself plunged into a series of increasingly twisted events, from which he ends up battling for survival.

The horror genre is in a pretty desperate state of affairs at the moment, certainly not a patch on its heyday twenty/thirty years ago. When they're not remaking old classics, they're just making films that rely on cheap jump scares in place of anything that really gets under your skin. And so, it's a really nice surprise when something like Get Out comes along, which gives you faith that there's still life in the old dog yet. First time director Jordan Peele gets back to basics with what traditionally made the genre so great, in a film that's also from the producers of such hits as Insidious and The Gift.

Peele understands that a creepy air of mystery and a foreboding sense of the unknown are far more effective tools than cheap shocks and gore, and what works in Get Out's favour so well is a genuinely intriguing and exciting story that really leaves you wondering what is going on, when it will kick off and how it will all work out. It's brave, as well, tackling the themes of an inter-racial relationship in the modern world, and constructing one of the most paranoid and outlandish reasons for what could be behind it. There's some light and humour, as well, with subtle little digs and nods thrown in that few will be unlikely to pick up on.

As a horror fan, this emerges as a genuinely pleasant surprise, and my only regret is that I didn't see it sooner. *****"
345,"9/10 | There was enormous hype surrounding this film, which is the main reason I watched it, but also the main reason why I felt uncomfortable watching it for a long time before that. If you are reading this, it's probably too late to not watch the trailer or read the commentaries on it, but I am warning you anyway. Because it is a racially loaded film, there are a lot of people who focus on that for some reason. Also, while I gave it a full ten stars, this is compared to other thrillers, not movies in general.

That said, the film is a slow paced thriller. Things start cool, then they get weirder and weirder until the final climax. The story is ingenious, but nothing you haven't seen before in such movies. What I found interesting was the acting, the direction and the script, so all the qualities that I enjoy in a movie. Jordan Peele obviously did a good job, but Daniel Kaluuya (my man) hit all the right notes. The hallmark of a good thriller (perhaps of any genre) is that it has a main character that you can relate to, and ""Chris Washington"" did all the things I believe a normal person would do in that situation.

What this film did not have: jump scares (well, they had one, but it was at the beginning and I can forgive it), group of friends building fear off each other, people that behave dumb, hysterical or malevolent just to make the story less boring, a predictable script. Well, it was kind of predictable, but I'd read the reviews, hence my warning. The story also lends itself to nice prequels and even sequels, but I think it said what it was set to say. I also liked that they didn't try to explain it too much: stuff just happens and it's the point of view of the lead character that takes precedence over everything else, while the role of the viewer is to interpret it as they see fit.

What could have gone better: editing out the scene at the beginning with the other black guy.

Bottom line: a nail-biting success. Worth watching. Also, check out the alternate ending of the movie, that is roaming the Internet out there."
346,"8/10 | The big surprise break-out hit of 2017, ""Get Out"" has received a lot of critical acclaim and still should be considered to be an underrated movie; that's how good it is. The movie does not necessarily use the most original concept (we have seen similar things with ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" before), but the movie mainly benefits from its clever storytelling - because sometimes it's not about which story you are trying to tell, sometimes it's about how you are trying to tell it.

The brilliant actors (Allison Williams was surprisingly good, Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford were as good as was to be expected, and boy, was Daniel Kaluuya amazing) added to the film's success, as well as its better-than-brilliant directing. Jordan Peele easily deserves an Academy Award nomination for his work as an director; and it's easy to see how much effort and lifeblood flew into the making of this movie. ""Get Out"" is a horror movie, but not necessarily a horror movie in the original sense of the word; you won't find much blood, just as you won't find many jump scares - in this movie, it's all about the tension, meaningful dialogues, more tension, tension, tension. And it's incredibly well done. Not a single scene has been wasted, every little aspect of the movie has a purpose, and ultimately, that's what movies should be about: telling a story with so much love for its details that a viewer can simply sink into the movie and forget what's happening around him. Jordan Peele has already mastered this art in his directing debut."
347,"8/10 | I've been a fan of horror movies and thrillers ever since I figured out how the TV worked. Always preferred older movies but also always kept my eyes and mind open for new instant classics. The problem is that so very few REALLY good horror movies come out nowadays, and when I read exaggeratedly praising and positive reviews about an alleged new masterpiece, I automatically become skeptical. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" was such an example. Literally everybody, acclaimed critics as well as ordinary mainstream audiences, was mad-raving enthusiast about ""Get Out"" and now it's even nominated for several Oscars, including best picture and best screenplay! I honestly must admit I never expected that a film like this would ever become nominated for the most important categories in such a hypocrite and predetermined contest for the elite. It'll never win, of course, but still.

It must be underlined that ""Get Out"" isn't groundbreakingly original, extremely intelligent or a genuine masterwork of scripting. There are, however, many things that the film - and the debuting director Jordan Peele in particular - does exceptionally well. First and foremost, the atmosphere! Although not featuring any graphic violence for the largest part of the film, the atmosphere is continuously ominous and hinting at something dreadful that can occur at any given moment. There's only a very selected number of classic horror films that uphold the ""there's something terribly wrong here"" sentiment for so long, and it provides ""Get Out"" with the same unique vibe as pure classics like ""Seconds"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and ""The Stepford Wives"" (the 1975 original, of course, not the idiotic Nicole Kidman remake). Secondly, you just cannot surpass Peele's truly unsurpassable approach of racial differences! Without explicitly mentioning about racial tension or introducing obviously racist characters, Peele shows that racial segregation is irreversibly integrated in our modern day social culture. This aspect of ""Get Out"" is indescribably unique, in fact. The harder the protagonists try to profile themselves as anti-racist, the more uncomfortable you get with them. Equally brilliant in this domain are the setting, costumes and tiny little details. The word ""slavery"" is never said out loud, yet look at the Armitage mansion, the style of their household staff and the crucial role of cotton at a certain point. Thirdly, and this is a joint effort with the ensemble cast, the performances in ""Get Out"" are extremely high standard. Atypical role or not, Daniel Kaluuya truly deserves the Best Actor nomination for his depiction of the insecure, skeptical and visibly petrified Chris Washington.

What's the story about, then? Well, I'm convinced that ""Get Out"" is one of those films for which they invented the rule of: ""the less you know the better"". Personally, I think that even rudimentary elements like the title or the cast list already reveal too much. If I was Jordan Peele, I would have named the film ""What is happening here?"" or ""This doesn't feel right"", but of course I respect their choice from a marketing point of view. I'm well aware of the fact that most reviews provide at least a brief synopsis or hint at vital twists in the third act, but my advice is to know as little as possible before you watch. I can't finish the review without mentioning that ""Get Out"" isn't flawless. Notably the comic relief aspect, provided mainly by Lil Rel Howery , isn't the least bit impressive and even somewhat misplaced. In a way, Jordan Peele is guilty of racial stereotyping himself with this, although I reckon it was a deliberate choice. He's a comedian, after all."

350,"8/10 | I...don't...get it. I had high hope's to find out what was going on with these rich white folks. When it was finally revealed what was going, all I could think was, HUH??!! I thought it was just downright moronic. I did think the racial barriers the movie tried to overcome (interracial relationships, treating others with respect no matter what race they are, etc.) was commendable but it wasn't enough to save the film. That was a big let down for a horror fan who was looking forward to this movie.

351,"8/10 | When I had finished watching this, I felt the film-viewing equal of 'Wow, that was a really satisfying meal!' And I had really not been expecting it to be as good as it was. I don't mean that I thought it would be trash or b-grade. I just wasn't expecting something so powerful really, as a horror, as a dark comedy, as satire and as social commentary.

I loved this film's use of metaphors. Others here have drawn attention to the themes of covert racism that is a disease of power, control and dominance of whites over blacks whilst projecting a smiling, friendly face. Yes. Absolutely. And also about cultural appropriation; admiration and envy for those attributes of a people where there is no respect for the people as fully human beings, even often as not fully sentient beings, less than animals.'Stuff' to be exploited for one's own benefit. I am very sure this is what the 'dark place' alludes to, being pushed into a place of nowhere as your world is gradually stolen from you.

The humour in this that is not really satire, is found in relief scenes centred around Chris's (the victim) best friend who senses something is NQR from the beginning but cannot persuade his friend of this.

I look forward to more from this writer/director."
352,"8/10 | This movie lived up the hype. Fantastic, entertaining and thought provoking.

The time has come for Chris, a young black man to meet his girlfriend's (Rose) white family. They are polite and seem to be warm, but there are some things that Chris just can't put his finger on. Oddities repeatedly bubble up and something is definitely amiss with the two black servants, but what Chris just can't pinpoint.

Strap in for a wild ride! The ending oh the ending. I will never think of TSA the same way again.

355,"8/10 | Not since the 2003 film ""Identity"" have I been as surprised by an ending. This movie is an innovative gem that you might have to watch twice to fully appreciate. Not really a fan Jordan Peele's show on Comedy Central, but he did a superb job of writing, co-producing and directing ""Get Out"" and I eagerly anticipate his next project. Hard to discuss this movie without giving away too much, but I will say this, it makes a profound social statement, while still remaining a bit scary and thoughtfully entertaining. Good job by these talented actors of conveying this weird, yet relevant tale.

356,"8/10 | ""I told you not to go into that house."" Chris Washington (Kaluuya) and Rose (Williams) have been dating for awhile and Rose is finally ready to introduce Chris to her family. Almost immediately Chris feels something is strange with the family and the longer he stays the more bizarre and terrifying things become. This is one of the most disturbing movies I have seen in a long time. There are horror movies and then there are movies like this. This movie is very real that's what makes it disturbing. The movie deals with race issues in a way that may make some people uncomfortable, but that's the point of the movie. This is a movie that is one that needs to be seen, talked about and understood in ways that horror movies usually aren't. This is not just a horror movie it is an important film that I recommend. Overall, disturbingly real and that's what makes it a horror movie. I give this an A-.

357,"8/10 | It's hard to find a good film to recommend these days, but this is. It was original and surprising. It is filled with tension and its fast- paced so it keeps your interest throughout the film. The acting is good. The dialogues are good. It was better than I expected. It's not exactly a horror film (which I don't tend to like). And it felt like an instant classic. I recommend this one.

359,"8/10 | I was curious about the hype. While I don't think it is an astonishing film or anything huge or completely new, I cannot deny its a refreshingly original approach of the racism topic. It is like 12 Years a Slave as a horror film, in some ways at least. Also the twists the film contained kept me interested throughout the whole time (although the midsection had some lengths, but that was essential for the ending). The acting was solid. I really liked Daniel Kaluuya who I foresee to have a great career in Hollywood. Such a charismatic and expressional actor who hit all the right tones with his performance. Also Allison Williams was decent and charismatic. We will see more of her too. Always nice to see Catherine Keener. Bradley Whitford was also fine. Caleb Landry Jones creepy as usual but he really is good at that. Would make a great Joker one day. Great soundtrack that was only a small part of the excellent symbolism provided by Jordan Peele throughout the film. The screenplay was the MVP for sure. The ending revelation was a bit too out of this world and exaggerated for me, the rest worked as a fine horror drama with a lot of depths."
360,"8/10 | In a cinema full of suspense movies, ""Corra"" does not revolutionize the genre, but does in a daring and different way, joining blockbuster to a highly artistic cinema, we do not have that session of a fright for minutes and no shallow characters with Ghostly characters, complex characters, high development, social criticism, a spectacular direction and great performances, the daring novice Jordan Pele, accustomed to acting, and making his directorial debut recalls names like Spielberg for betting that Artistic side aligned to a good script is better than an appeal to call the public, also has a Stephen King side, for transforming from something so mundane and natural into something that walks the linearity of the supernatural and occult and why not even Hitchcock and even Shyamalan , And at times he very much remembers Scorsese's ""The Island of Fear"", for Jordan, makes ""Run"" a scrap of the best Suspense has to offer, even if it makes small mistakes. ""Run"" tells the story of Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young black man who goes inside to meet his girlfriend's parents, Rose (Allison Williams), arriving at the house, Chris begins to realize that family has something to hide ... It seems even an afternoon session synopsis, but the film goes beyond, the script is great, it's linear, it knows how to create a tension like few, this the first second of the movie we notice that something is wrong, this is the first The movie has a comic relief that bothers it, it breaks the tension of the film, the movie goes through more than an hour building a tension, and instead of letting the viewer enter, conjecture and reflect until a Hypothesis about the construction of the film, everything we imagine about the outcome is verbalized in a joke, and this is horrible, even the final solution being very creative, the last scene does not please, but it's not all bad either. The film criticizes a post- modern slavery, and the whole movie is surrounded by a racial tension that is suffocating, even though they are stereotyped in some points, the film makes us feel disgusted with characters not by themselves verbalize rampant racism, but rather By hiding it, this is new, it is well built, and leaves a very nice criticism. Unlike most suspense movies where tension has to be created, ""Run"" has an extremely clear photograph, with a warm palette, his photograph is almost cheerful. Permeated by a sensational soundtrack, which goes from Hip-Hop to classical music, it is here that, in due proportion, Jordan jokes about being Hitchcock, using the conductor and thermostat music of the audience, the sound design does not have to be used To scare, because the goal is not this, it is to create tension, and the soundtrack is completely perfect in that aspect, another thing that is perfect is the game of camera that Jordan uses, also emulating Hitchcock, the camera does not stop filming a Frame, she has life, because even with a few movements, she creates an absolute tension, always knowing to position herself in the right angle, she films the characters in a way, that even everyone smiling and cheerful, you get stuck in the chair and clenched fist , Because he knows that something is wrong, we can not fail to mention the rhythm that is going on in an extremely visible rising wave and that he acts the acts excellently, and contributes not only to the construction of the tension, but the construction Plot and character. With a cast, that even being little known, is completely fabulous, I will not mention all the actors, because even the secondary characters haunt, even that character in the background, who does not have some annoying dialogue, all are wonderful, but I will cite our Protagonist, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), because it is what has a more different performance, because it is what makes the pape feel uncomfortable and intuitive with the situation, even with few words and few expressions, Daniel has an incredible posture, and A verbal communication that speaks for itself, this is very interesting, which creates an actor of many facets and complete. ""Run"" has problems, it's true, but it's still exciting, it's different, and it's suspense in its fullest naturalness"
361,"8/10 | When Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has to go to visit his girlfriend's parents he worries that they don't know he is black and that this might arouse problems. Yet, upon meeting them they appear more than welcoming until strange occurrences in the house and to him start freaking him out and ultimately lead to the discovery of a terrible mystery.

""Get Out"" is possibly the culmination of the last few years of great horror and finally solidifies Blumhouse Productions as one of the main protagonists of the modern horror golden age, other than introducing the movie going public to the mind of writer/director Jordan Peele and his stunning sensibilities in genre filmmaking.

What is possibly the most indicative aspect of this film's incredible success is the molding of tones and, as in all in great genre clashes, it makes the comedy and the horror work together and function on the same beats. That is something that is rarely found and when it does work it works to these incredible effects: there are moments where the tension is building and building to incredible stress levels and it gets released with comedy beats that are genuinely funny and laugh out loud moments as much as they are fu*king creepy twisted moments that add to the white-knuckled thriller aspect of the film.

The picture is intense, really intense. It does not let you breathe for a second and I loved every moment of it, it always had me on the tip of my toes, I did not know what was coming next, sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or to be scared and it just got me to this place of being totally locked into it with my body, it affected me physically and that is one of the best compliments you could ever give to a motion picture. Peele knows every trick in the box of how to play the audience and he rarely ever makes a false step in guiding us through the story. The scene weave is flawless and every new bit of information is delivered at the perfectly right time and escalates to twists and twists on twists which never lost me and actually ratcheted up the tension.

It is clear that there is a lot of influences moving Peele around and it is a testament to his cinematic ability that they are never bluntly thrown at your face, instead they are used in a complementary way to bring us a delicious mix of everything. Edgar Wright, Quentin Tarantino, Roman Polanski all transpire beautifully through this film, yet possibly the best one that we get is Hitchcock. On one side we see the homages and the subtle similarities that only make the film better on another it just made me remember why Hitchock was and is the best and why his lessons are universal.

There isn't much to point out here on the negative side, the film flows and hits you without having any stumbles on the way. There are little moments where the quirky, off beat atmosphere gets amplified to 110% and you may start to feel a little overwhelmed, but it picks up immediately and doesn't really leave any trace of that on the film. I think that a 10 or so minutes cut down could have benefited the film in making it even more hard hitting as there are little moments that drag and a couple of plot beats that are explained to the audience shamelessly when they could have been entrusted to work it out by themselves.

""Get Out"" is a hard hitting Comedy/Horror, incredibly original and fresh and made with a stunning craft in filmmaking, especially considering this is a feature debut. It scared me, it made me laugh out loud and it made me sweat, a lot, I really enjoyed it."
362,"8/10 | Let's face it, the horror genre seems to have got even more stale than ever lately. Sure, ever since 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' kind of launched the 'slasher' sub-genre of mainstream horror, many films have followed that particular layout, especially when teens were the leads. However, I'm pleased to say that 'Get Out' is actually a breath of – pretty horrific – fresh air.

I'm going to get the word out the way straight away – awkward. Yes, this film's primary emotion it generates in you is not fear, disgust or dread. It's awkwardness (an emotion we've all felt from time to time and one more associated with turning up to work in trainers in an office full of people in smart shoes than full blown horror). However, there's more to it than that.We meet a young mid-twenties couple who are returning to her parents' house in a small, but 'respectable' town in 'Middle America.' Nothing particularly out of the ordinary there, but Chris Washington is a black man and his girlfriend, Rose Armitage, is white. Again, nothing that would raise an eyebrow in most places these days, but this is – at heart and despite its overall awkwardness – a horror movie after all.

When this black man arrives in his potential inlaws' house, there's quite an uncomfortable feeling in the air. They're not racists or bigots, just people who haven't really experienced people of other cultures and races – queue the start of the awkwardness. They do their best to make him feel welcome, constantly referencing supposedly 'black' culture in an effort to make him feel at home. But there's still that awkwardness in the air that something else is going on. This is the point where I can't say too much more without dipping my toe into the territory of 'spoilers.' I will just say that if you thought Ben Stiller had it bad in 'Meet the Parents' you won't believe what poor Chris Washington has to go through! Eventually, the awkwardness and uncomfortable atmosphere cracks and 'Get Out' turns into what it's meant to be – something pretty horrible. It's definitely a pleasant change from the slasher/zombie horror films which seem to be infesting the cinema these days. The closest film I could liken it to may be a certain other dark classic from the seventies starring (amongst others) Nannette Newman, but I'll leave you to wait and see any slight similarities. It does touch on quite a few modern issues with race and the perception thereof, however it's never preachy or annoying by trying to put its message over the fact that it's a dark, disturbing film first (social commentary later!).

'Get Out's' primary strength is its two young leads. They have to be believable as a normal couple who you can relate to in order for us to buy into their plight. And they do. Daniel Kaluuya (Chris Washington) ultimately carries the film and it's impossible not to sympathise for him when the bad stuff really starts to happen. All in all, whatever your politics, as long as you enjoy good, solid, slow-burning horror films which gradually crank up the tension, you really do need to watch this."
363,"8/10 | I must say that I was delightfully please by watching this movie. It is rare to find talent in Hollywood these days so when a movie like this comes along and gives us a script and performance we have our faith that all is not lost in the art of cinema. There are a lot of Hitchcockian elements in this picture, despite some comedic scenes, and the actors involved all keep us hooked in our seats. I also got the feel that there were some elements of H. P. Lovecraft sewn into this story. I don't know if that was deliberate, accidental or just my modest impression, but the writers have truly outdone themselves. Bravo!

364,"8/10 | don't... just watch the movie

I think the trailer gives too much away. read the very basic synopsis, and if thats what you are after in a movie, watch it.

It's well done, well told, and strange. there are things you see coming a miles away and others you don't. From the trailer I felt I had already watched the movie, guessed the twists and ending.

Although the ending was different to what I expected, I later read that it was changed from the original script due to recent events, which is why it looks a little out of place, but actually might work better.

Don't want to say much more, just advise anyone interested in it to just watch and not look too much into it beforehand."
365,"10/10 | I don't usually do reviews but I can say this movie is worth watching. It may not be super good but it is the kind of movie that will keep your interest as you are watching. I refrain anyone to know so much about the movie cause it is better that way. I can also say that this movie is well written for most part like for the part with the police and the protagonist which I just realize now lol. I also love the satisfying ending. The protagonist is also not dumb or stupid until the end cause I think he acts like what a normal person will do on that kind of situation without second thinking. So if you are in doubt like myself at first just go see it and enjoy your time.

366,"10/10 | A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate."" This movie is quite Unique and in its own way. The moment it starts we are thrown into the typical Girlfriend/boyfriend plot along with the Meet The Parents. However what makes this movie so special is how it takes all the old classic clichés and turns it into something extremely original. We all know from the beginning that there is something wrong, but the problem is the audience can never figure out what is wrong and the direction the film is going to go.

The acting was spot on by everybody, especially Daniel Kaluuya and Alison Williams. The direction by Jordan Peele was surprisingly spot on and he manages to mix Horror and Humor into this extremely well. It also moves along at a good pace, and it keeps you guessing what the heck is going on. The music was spot on as well. Very unsettling, extremely over the top, but it suites each scene perfectly. I don't think there's anything I would change in the movie.

By the time you get to the end and you have figured everything out it really does make you wander how they managed to pull it all off! There is a lot of racial stereotype in this movie. I think it works, though. It never really goes full on with the racial stuff, but there are several scenes that may offend or even just make people shake their heads, but in the end it's just a movie and it's for pure entertainment. The Autistic Reviewers give this 4/5 stars. It really is a great and unique film. We both highly recommend it to all of you. It's already getting attention at the Mtv Movie Awards, so there's a sign it's very popular! The Autistic Reviewers. Check us out on facebook or Instagram!"
367,"9/10 | Jordan Peele makes his very interesting directorial debut in racial commentary/horror film ""Get Out"". I really enjoyed this movie, the lead Daniel Kaluuya was really good in this movie and he portrays such an interesting character. The supporting cast was also amazing including, Betty Gabriel who plays the housekeeper Georgina.

What was really great about Get Out is its ability to blend comedy with horror tropes, so this is really something to congratulate Jordan Peele on in his directorial debut and it would be very interesting to see what he has to come. I believe that many of Jordan's personal experiences come through in this film as well, I do believe hearing Jordan Peele commenting in one interview about how he often feels uncomfortable if he was the only black person amongst a group of white people. That sense of paranoia really comes through and is fully understandable and relatable for a non-white viewer like me. However Jordan Peele takes a more comedic route with this adding some light heartedness to an otherwise serious topic.

The horror and underlying mystery of this movie was also really great and the build up to the ultimate reveal was a very good process of which tension arise, so the horror aspect was taken care of also."
368,"9/10 | There are some films which you never want to end. There are some films that have a lifetime lasting impact on you. There are some films that once the credits roll you gasp in awe and stop for a minute and think Holy Ssshhh that was a work of genius.

If you can't tell I think Get Out is one such film. In fact I think it might be the best Horror film i've seen since the Shining. And i don't say that lightly.

Massive respect to Jordan Peels for writing and directing this masterpiece. Please keep the Horrors coming, the genre needs you.

The casting was spot on and the acting was top notch as was the MUSIC composition.

Deserves a couple of Oscars for sure.

370,"8/10 | Let me get this out of the way early: This is 100% a remake of the movie 'The Skeleton Key'.

Now that that is out of the way, I will start by saying that I really enjoyed this film. The cast and acting was great. The music score was phenomenal and perfectly fitting with each scene. The camera work was above average. Plenty of tension breaking moments of levity that were really well executed.

One of my biggest gripes about this movie though has to be the pacing of how they reveal the story. You see the ""twist"" if you can even call it that, a mile away. The movie is aware of this fact and nearly breaks the 4th wall to the audience in recognizing this fact. I'm not sure this entirely makes up for it though, as it just comes off as generally lazy writing.

All in all great flick. If you enjoyed the movie skeleton key, you will enjoy this."

373,"10/10 | Get Out. Since I have seen the trailer I had promising expactaitions. But leave the expectations. Here they don't matter, because someone could've expected something more or something else.

Here we talk about, how effecting is the movie. And it is so so well. The plot, the story, the screenplay, the cast, everything matched exactly perfect. And the result is an incredible film that I loved. Yes, I love that kind of movies. It wasn't horror, although there were moments of course which were compilling and they were scary, shocking... But that was great made. Mystery, thriller, it was on higher level, on higher effort with such brilliant power.

Everything fits. It is ideal. I don't have anything I could say there would be more, but even if I had it is never for bad. But this movie was sinless.

The cast was awesome. Solid and brilliant. Daniel Kaluuya was incredible. I have no other words.

I just watched it and wanted to write about it right away, so I could say it as clear as I could and to think about it a bit more. Now I am going to sleep with the though of the great work, all the staff had done. Bravo. Well well done!"

375,"7/10 | Not since Blacula in the early Seventies has a brilliant African-American film electrified the horror audience and changed the way the mainstream audience thinks about race, horror, and the power of storytelling. But where Blacula was patterned after the relatively mild, almost romantic horror films of the early Thirties, GET OUT is a relentlessly terrifying thriller that captures the stifling, shocking paranoia of ROSEMARY'S BABY, THE STEPFORD WIVES, and even darker classics like THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.

By now everyone knows the basic plot -- a young black man visits his white girlfriend's parents in the luxurious home deep in the country. This journey is an ironic reversal of Marlowe's journey up the Congo in HEART OF DARKNESS. Daniel Kaluuya plays Chris, the innocent victim turned hero who becomes the perfect symbol of the courage, decency, and humanity that white America so often refuses to acknowledge in young black men. No one else has said it, but it seems to me that Kaluuya's performance is strengthened by his uncanny resemblance to a great black actor who left us much too soon -- Howard Rollins. The movie plays with the fact that Chris is much like the black officer Rollins played in A SOLDIER'S STORY -- the honest observer, the courageous truth seeker, the lone survivor. There are moments that seem torn right out of the earlier classic, just in the way Chris shows so much sadness with his eyes as the other black characters are demeaned and humiliated.

But this is not just one man's story. Allison Williams as Rose Armitage is a revelation. Again, it's astonishing the way this gifted and sensationally gorgeous young actress channels the aura of earlier icons. Early in the picture, Rose comes across as exactly the character a young Jane Fonda or Katharine Hepburn might have played. She's the aristocratic ingenue with a prim demeanor and passion lurking underneath, seemingly cool but full of red blood and passion as well as sympathy for the less fortunate. The genius of this movie is that it takes this archetype, so beloved by white liberals, and then transforms the character in ways that are both terrifying and darkly funny.

Catherine Keener as Mama Armitage was equally unforgettable. I'd seen her in a light-hearted comedy, HAMLET 2 with Steve Coogan. I noticed then that she has a way of striking sparks, sounding discordant notes, making the story turn dark just by her very presence. Here she's even more sensational!

This movie is one of those rare classics that feels totally original -- yet at the same time it's full of tributes to earlier films. You can't see Chris tied up in a chair and shedding tears without picturing Alex in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The use of hypnosis brings back memories of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. Nothing ever feels fake or added for effect -- GET OUT just resembles those earlier classics because of its power, style, and depth.

GET OUT is a movie that has no weak spots, no slow scenes, no bad performances. It's the most economical thriller I've ever seen. You will not forget this young man's journey into a uniquely American vision of hell."

379,"8/10 | This first-time director manages to create an unbelievable and surprising horror flick that was hysterically funny at parts. The film is filled with good performances and fun characters with a realistic storyline and quite relatable to many people, not the supernatural bit though! ... the 'meeting the parents' bit! The scenes when the couple arrives at the parent's estate are fun and enjoyable to watch, much like the scenes when the supernatural stuff begins! The film as a whole is quite creepy and features a disturbing performance played brilliantly by Caleb Landry Jones. The film could be classed as a horror comedy though, mainly due to LilRel Howery's hysterical performance with his random outbursts that resulted in the entire cinema completely losing it! This benefited the film as it created a fun cinema experience that you can enjoy with a group of friends! Some may argue that the comedy element may take away from the horror aspect of the film but I'd have to disagree, there is a perfect mix between both that results in a fantastic modern horror flick and the best I've seen in a very long time! Also, this is definitely a contender for my favourite film of 2017 so far! I absolutely recommend this brilliant horror-comedy as it delivers on all levels and I can't wait to see more from Jordan Peel in the future!"

382,"10/10 | I have until very recently had a problem sleeping. You see when I was in bed I'd be lying there and I'd suddenly have enraged thoughts as to the Oscars being too white. Words can not convey just grief stricken and tortured I was knowing that once again the Academy Awards were going to gift accolades to white film makers once again damaged me mentally . emotionally and physically. Thankfully all this was cured when MOONLIGHT won the Best Picture this year. All the world's wrongs had now been righted in what must be the most important event ever since the big bang 13.8 billion years ago. Now the only thing bothering me is that every time I watch a horror thriller is that the token black character gets bumped off early. Along comes GET OUT which has received universal praise and features a black director/screenwriter in Jordan Peele and stars black actor Daniel Kaluuya so there's no way a clichéd thriller where the first scene features a token black character getting killed

!!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!

So the first scene features a black man walking along a dark lonely street .. Then he's attacked. I suppose this is an example of post modernism? Thankfully this is more than tokenism because we're introduced to the main character Chris Washington who is African American and has a white girlfriend Rose who drives him to her middle class WASP parents home. There's two things that can happen at this scenario. One is the middle WASP class parents slam the door in their face and disown their daughter. The other scenario is boyfriend is greeted as a respected new addition to the household and he soon wishes the parents had slammed the door in his face

To be fair to Jordan Peele he has made a fairly effective and enjoyable tongue in cheek horror thriller. The only thing he can be criticised for is that the polite middle class White Anglo Saxon Protestant characters constantly reminded me a little too much of THE STEPFORD WIVES. Apart from that it's an entertaining film. The downside is that it's really nothing more than that and I'm slightly surprised as well as puzzled by the hype and acclaim surrounding GET OUT. It goes without saying that the hype works against. Watch the film but don't expect a masterwork of cinema otherwise you'll be left with a feeling of disappointment"
383,8/10 | 
384,"1/10 | It took me a while to get to this one, and it's because I knew the general plotline and I thought maybe it would be a little too hamfisted for me to enjoy, and I also knew that any movie with that kind of premise would be adored by the critics, whether it was actually good or not.

Turns out this movie managed to be nuanced, deeply unsettling, heart-pumping thrilling and downright hilarious all at once. It really hits every mark you could ever want from a movie like this. Daniel Kaluuya did a spectacular job, and although there are a lot of excellent survivor-trope characters played by excellent actors in a lot of great horror/slasher/thrillers, I honestly think Kaluuya takes the cake for being the absolute best. Which is not something I say lightly, since I am a huge fan of thriller/slasher/horrors with the survivor turning the tables during the climax, particularly when they have a unique twist (a la ""You're Next"", ""The House of the Devil"", ""Babysitter""). Basically what I'm trying to say is that while this movie is in a lot of ways a very particular trope that is popular right now (and that I happen to love), it also manages to be incredibly fresh and unpredictable.

I found myself wanting to re-watch the movie immediately after finishing it. And if you're like me, and you find the ""white people are all veiled racists"" messaging in a movie incredibly off-putting (which is the reason I stupidly avoided this classic for so long), just forget all that and watch the movie anyways. When it comes to the racial element, I think there's a number of different ways you could read into it, and IMO that was entirely intentional.

The important and enjoyable part of this movie (I think) is just how well it puts the viewer in Chris' shoes, such that you can't help but feel the confusion, suspicion, terror and then dread at all the exact same moments he does. Even if you know precisely what's coming. That may not sound like a lot, but particularly for a seasoned horror movie fan, it's exceedingly rare that a movie hits the notes at just the right times in just the right ways to put the audience right into the protagonists shoes every single time. It's terrifying, unsettling, funny and satisfying in a way most horror movies try desperately to be, but very rarely succeed in actually being. Get Out succeeds over and over and over and over. Just watch it."
385,"9/10 | Finally saw ""Get Out"" one of the most talked about movies of 2017 and I must say this work from director Jordan Peele was interesting as it's a take on society and a spin on race and class as it's blended with themes and elements of drama and horror and the film twist with suspense it's a real guesser and almost mind numbing.

The story is that of an interracial couple Chris(newcomer Daniel Kaluuya) and Rose(Allison Williams from ""HBO's"" ""Girls"") who one weekend drive to visit the well to do parents of Rose. And from the start Chris feels out of place even though Rose swears that her parents are not against black people. Still all of the hired help and servants are black it seems like slave days. And the talk and questions used around Chris make him uncomfortable.

Then strange happenings begin is it real or is just Chris seeing things? This film has you thinking too, as it's a plague as it's like Chris is falling deeper and deeper into this secret society as his entire mind and world is changing. Really this picture is a strange and different style of horror suspense drama that twist with a spin of race and social themes."
386,"8/10 | The less you know about this movie before you watch it, the better. It's a creepy, delicious thriller, and one where even when you think you know what might be going on, there's more to it than you realize. There are elements that feel derivative, but on the other hand, Director Jordan Peele tells this story well, and it feels fresh and intelligent. Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams turn in very nice performances, and the supporting cast is solid as well. I loved Lil Rel Howery, who plays the friend, a TSA agent who tries to help from afar. There are many great moments – the round of ""Bingo"" led by the father, Kaluuya seeing the pictures of Williams and her expression on that last one, and the effects going to the ""sunken place"". It also puts a mirror up to how white people in real life, even well-meaning ones, sometimes talk to African-Americans in their attempts to relate to them or 'be cool' – stilted, with references that often bring up race, and at least sometimes subtly racist. How great it was to see a diverse cast, and to see this perspective, without it being delivered in a heavy-handed manner. It's not original enough to be in a list of greatest ever thrillers, but it's solid and enjoyable from beginning to end."

You'll see how they use hypnosis to make them slaves and they got already a whole bunch of brothas. This is it, to quote somehow what is saying the funniest character, Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery). He's the best! All the actors are very special, the director is very good, the music, the editing, a very special film.

395,"8/10 | As a huge fan of horror movies I was really looking forward to this one because the premise was fairly unique and you don't see a lot of horror movies that are written and directed by, and also star, black people. I was disappointed. Let me get one thing straight. This is NOT a horror movie. It's more of a social commentary wrapped in a strange mystery. It wasn't scary, nor was it particularly thrilling. It was slow at times and it ultimately failed to deliver the twist in a way that you wouldn't have anticipated. I have no desire to re-watch this one. One viewing was enough for me, so I can't give it anything above a five.

But this one was awesome... It's very well-written, very well-acted and quite great... Not for the brain dead though...

Though one thing, try to avoid trailers... I don't know who creates them, and why they make them so, they give away like half the movie with it...

The writer/director is really great... Check out his Key and Peele show if you haven't already...

I speak about the beginning, the basic opening scheme, not the whole story, of course. This one is a sort of horror, and also social film, very tense, tight, brilliant, intelligent, where characters are so perfectly introduced in the story. This is a masterpiece to e, a study about racism through the prism of a high grade B picture. You can't not enjoy it. No, honestly you can not. That's impossible.

399,"1/10 | This movie is a mixture of comedy and somewhat horror although I did not find it scary whatsoever. To me it felt more of a comedy and thriller, because the scary characters aren't scary. This movie does have good soundtrack, great acting by the black actors but the white actors are just bland. This movie would of been better if the white actors were maybe more scarier. However, it does keep you entertained depending on what you're into. If you're open minded and like thrillers and a bit of comedy then this movie is for you. In conclusion, this movie is a bit too overhyped but still very enjoyable.

401,"1/10 | As a straight white man who identifies as a gay black female I found the racial message of this movie too confusing for me to bother working out if I was either highly delighted or highly offended by it, so no dice there.

What did offend me was the utterly generic dialogue, acting, and script, which all could've easily been lifted from any other also-ran US horror/thriller from the last 15 years. The way everyone in these kind of movies all talk in that vaguely disinterested, pseudo-cryptic, casually sweary, oh-so-kewl way...It really gets on my big black breasts.

There I said it. I feel liberated.

403,"8/10 | I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very suspenseful throughout, even the beginning which left you wanting to understand what was going on. So why do I title this, ""Is this really necessary""? I just don't get it why movies feel compelled to use foul language throughout the whole movie, which I found distracting. Don't get me wrong, I was not offended with it, just find that someone who uses that language on just about every line of the script is not very imaginative with their character. I find it refreshing when script writers, actors and directors refrain from it for the most part to tell a story. This movie would have been better if they cut out 50%.

I would have given this movie a 10+ if it wasn't for the unnecessary language. By the way, using foul language only serves one purpose; you don't have anything intelligent to say in a sentence. Think about it.

404,"4/10 | What a fresh wind of creativity exuding from that ""little"" movie.

And by little, there's no disrespect meant of course, just highlighting the not-so-trivial fact that this is a directorial debut from Jordan Peele with an actor who was relatively unknown Mr. Daniel Keluuya, and yet what we've got here is a game-changer, one of these ""little"" movies popping out of nowhere but leaving in your mind the constant impression that they will be standing in cinematic memories for a long, long time. That's how 'good' ""Get Out"" is.

And I won't insist enough on its originality, if we were in 2007, I would have gone straight to the point but we're in 2017, a year where creativity seems to have been declining for good: Disney recycles the classics with the cheap excuse of money-grabbing live-action milking on previously built successes and big directors take the easy way of remaking, rebooting, and chaining up sequels, with no super vision and a lot of supervision. A time where the ""Star Wars"" series became a soap space opera and for all the noises these movies make, all is desperately quiet on the cinematic Western front.

Now, Jordan Peele's film is made of ""old stuff"" but only in the way it totally deconstructs all the usual infuriating tropes of the horror genre and features, for once, a protagonist who's smart enough to figure out when things go suspicious and a ""sidekick"" who incarnates our own point of view and never goes for the face-palm inducting choice. If LilRel Howery manages to slip through the image of the helpful comic relief, Keluuya is simply just too good for words, and his performance covers such a wide range of emotions that I doubt the Academy will overlook him.

Now it's been three paragraphs and I can't get to the story yet, don't take it as pompousness, this is the very indicator of my enthusiasm, I don't need to tell the story because it's so good I would rather invite anyone to go see what's so good in it. Let's just say that it opens like ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" where Chris Washington is getting ready for meeting the rich family of his white girlfriend Rose (Alison Williams) in a secluded house, the Armitages who can't stop delivering glorifying compliments on Obama or Jesse Owens yet hire black housekeepers who look so ""Uncle Tom"" it's painful to watch.

But the parts meant to raise our suspicion (I won't get too wordy on them) shine because of their roles within the plot and the various reactions of Keluuya. At first, he's not really in his element and tries to fit in, but his performance is so nuanced and subtle that sometimes you can feel the crispation in his smile, the unease in his eyes, and the way he always reaches for an eye contact with Allison, with the fragility of a child begging for a parent's reassuring sign. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener plays the Armitage parents and they're good at feigning emotions so that our suspicion is never pushed to that level where we expect the worst, Peele engages us in a harrowing journey where each step seems to take us downer toward a descent into hell but no matter what, we're never one step ahead of Chris.

The plot thickens with the first display of racism from the son, played by Caleb Landry Jones, and a mysterious group of white hosts coming for a garden party and where each one indulges to one of these patronizingly racist commentsturning slowly the film to an experience à la ""Rosemary's Baby"" where you can tell there's some conspiracy going on but people are so occasionally friendly, we're tempted, like Chris, to keep on a cool facade and give the benefit of the doubt. Of course, once Chris gets why he'd better get out, there's no way to get out and the film turns into one of the best horror movie experiences of recent years. I would go as far as saying that the film is an instant classic.

The action and the thrills escalate, driven by the usual horror elements, the deserted houses, the jump scares, a séance of hypnosis that alone should guarantee an Oscar nomination for Keluuya, but the film never recycles plot devices, it reinvents their use in a way that respects our intelligence. Indeed, ""Get Out"" is meant for viewers who've seen enough horror movies not to be tricked yet to better trick us. The film has an edge, a level of intelligence that is so bold and daring it can almost flirt with reverse parody, and maybe for that level of self-awareness, it has been nominated in the ""Comedy"" category for the Golden Globes"". Still, there's nothing comedic in the performances... although there are moments in the film that make you smile a lot... often, in a disturbing way.

So yes, this is a ""little"" movie that stands above all today's creations in a way I didn't think was possible. Let me explain this: I've often said that today, you could only make big budget blockbuster movies if you had a name OR an independent movie that tries to be socially relevant, you know, that deals with racism, politics, environment, men and women, homosexuality etc. It would be a lie to say that ""Get Out"" isn't relevant, it's perhaps one of the most intelligent recent movies to deal with racism especially in the way it highlights the mix of fascination and revulsion where the worst forms of racism are rooted... if it wasn't for that fascination, the plot wouldn't exist.

So, yes, ""Get Out"" is disturbing and subversively brilliant, but the social commentary is only one of the facets of its greatness, the film also works on the thrills' department and the way the action unfolds from one reveal to another until the climactic and satisfying conclusion... and that's only after a first viewing, I just realized that I failed to notice many hints and plot points and I guess it'll take me more viewings to get each time more of ""Get out""'s brilliance."
405,"5/10 | Even though I saw the twist and the plot strands coming fairly early on this will still a great riveting drama and Daniel was amazing.

407,"8/10 | This is not just an overrated movie, this is a terrible movie, lets get that straight first and foremost.

In all aspects from the screenplay to the art direction and film techniques this movie is trite, below average and exploitative, the acting is awful, the plot is a refried dumb cliche of a lowbrow dumb horror movie, there is no drama, no comedy, no horror, nothing thats worth saving, this movie conveys nothing of value, it has zero emotion is not even so bad its entertaining, its so bad is frustating and i wanted to honor the name and Get Out of the room.Make no mistake, This is even bad for the b movie category and the low budget slasher horror genre and that is saying something. I see no other reason for the hype other than an obvious political agenda and that alone not be so terrible if the movie wasnt as bad as it is and its themes so shallow, and mean spirited

This movie poses no debate and ask no questions worth considering, it simply puts forward it racism and expects you to praise it for it, which the acedemy seemed to do. I've never been head over heels about the oscars but nominating this is a travesty, even today it is ·number one or at least top five in ""movies of the decade"" list, showing how journalists and professional critics are in a debacle and so badly disconnected from reality, the audiences and moviemaking they basically get paid to make clowns of themselves, give banal excuses to praise smut while they insult the audiences intelligences throwing around buzzwords and smug political slogans , becoming a satire of themselves."
408,"2/10 | So I had to see like everyone else and watched it around 6 months ago, I was so bored and unimpressed with the movie I had to finish the last part another day. I think it's lazy, slow, sloppily written, a poor job of making what should have been good. Instead it's yet another movie like a few coughing others** in which the movie is hailed as life changing because the director was African American and therefore needs to be praised and given trophies for doing nothing

410,"8/10 | This movie is pure gold. It has nice twists, works on deeper levels, has some fascinating premises, is acted well, is original. Really, really nice job.

It is always nice to see movie with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought. But sometimes the twists are for the twist sake. This is not the case here. Everything makes sense, and in more than one level. The atmosphere of underlying racism is done in a way that makes people from across the world, who did not have contact with USA slavery issues, get good insight. But the movie is so much more than this, and will surprise you, make you think and leave you intellectually and emotionally satisfied. So few movies can do this as competently and decently as this one. This is one smart movie.

I don't feel offended at all I just felt bored, confused at foremost not entertained. The actors are good. That's all I can give that film. It wasn't funny, wasn't scary or wasn't clever. I just can't stand films that want to hit home a certain point which is clear after about 5 minutes into the film and then they just hammer home that point again and again and again. This seems like it should be a short film of a film student because it feels so small and so amateurish.

422,"1/10 | This is Jordan Peele's feature directorial debut, and what's interesting here is that GET OUT is uncharted territory for him as he comes from a comedic background. But, watching this movie, it felt like he's been directing horror his whole life. To put it simply, the guy knocks it out of the park.

It's an artfully crafted and remarkably accomplished debut. He exploits an atmosphere impregnated with tension and skillfully choreographs an escalation of unrelenting suspense and crowd-pleasing thrills. The camera-work was absolutely ingenious; there's a scene involving hypnosis, in particular that had my jaw hitting the floor. I loved how they visually achieved that heightened state of suggestibility on a visual level.

GET OUT is as much satire as it is horror though. And its most impressive feat is how masterfully it blends the two together. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that so seamlessly shifts from sequences of jubilant laughter to instances of insidious horror in a matter of minutes.

Writing satire is tough, writing good satire is even tougher, and writing good horror-satire is as rare of a commodity as you get in the film industry these days. To achieve this a film must have exquisite timing and near-prefect pacing, which is exactly what GET OUT has. The run-time is 103 minutes, yet it felt more like an hour. I guess I got so invested in this engaging story that I lost all sense of time, which is what you ultimately want in any movie, really.

Daniel Kaluuya showcases his acting chops with an impressive range of emotions; it's not necessarily what he says but what he doesn't say that has the biggest impact. Other standouts include Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, and Catherine Keener. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention comic Lil Rel Howery, who plays TSA agent Rod, aka the protagonist's best friend. He's definitely a scene-steal-er, breaking the film's uncanny tension with a number of gut-busting interludes.

While GET OUT sets out to mainly entertain and shock, it's also accompanied with some poignant social commentary. It shines light on the aspect of ourselves that we'd rather not acknowledge. No matter how much we try to convince ourselves that we're above implicit stereotyping or forming preconceptions, we aren't. Peele uses this unavoidable, unflattering truth to draw out anxiety, and then he uses that anxiety as fuel for the film itself.

GET OUT is one of the best movies to come out of 2017 thus far. I can't recommend it enough."

425,"10/10 | Get Out is an innovative and entertaining movie: a mix of Comedy, Thriller, Horror, Dramatic, Grotesque, Noir, Sentimental and Social Satire that succeeds as a horror movie even without the use of monstrosity, jump scare or blood, but thanks to really disquieting shots and facial expressions that keep the viewer alert. It is also a criticism of certain ""white people"" who voted for Obama: this movie unveils a less cliche', more politically correct and treacherous face of racism.

427,"9/10 | GET OUT was the most satisfying movie going experience I've had in a long time. It delivers brilliantly and viscerally in just the way that you want a paranoid horror thriller to but it also raises some topical questions within its horror conventions without undermining the fun and thrills. Jordan Peele definitely has a career ahead of him as a writer/director with a clever approach and a singular voice and vision when it comes to genre material.

The actors are uniformly excellent. Daniel Kaluuya is crucial to establishing the reality of the situation; he never overplays his character and you never catch him acting. Allison Williams is a pleasant surprise. I'd only known her from GIRLS and she shows a whole new potential here. LaKeith Stansfield is a star in the making; it's just that simple. Everything I see him in, he is impressive. The rest of the cast consists of some of the most reliable character actors working today, including a personal favorite: Stephen Root in a VERY surprising role.

GET OUT will be a future classic. You won't regret seeing it. It has several levels and it works smartly on all of them."

429,"9/10 | After sitting through two and a third long hours of ""IT"" recently, being bored mostly by the predictable CGI and the usual jolts in today's so called horror films, I just watched ""Get Out"". I wasn't expecting much, as the DVD had 5 mediocre to awful previews. But almost immediately, I became intensely involved by the plot and quality of this film, which mixes social satire and racial issues brilliantly. This is not like most horror films today, but rather more like suspense thrillers as ""The Stepford Wives"", ""the Harvest"", or ""The Tall Man"". The scares are not like jolts, but rather stem from the nervous feeling that kept me glued to the screen, anxious to see what will happen next. I just learned this was the director's first film, though it seemed to have excellent production values and built suspense seamlessly. I love stories where something strange is going on, and the mystery is gradually revealed, like the original ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" or ""Night Of The Living Dead"". For those not looking for gore or shocks, but rather suspense, this should satisfy most of you. But if special effects are your preference, maybe stay away."
430,"9/10 | ""Get Out"" was written and directed by Jordan Peele and was his directorial debut. And a hot item on his resume it is too.

Daniel Kaluuya (""Sicario"") plays African-American Chris Washington who, nervously, takes a trip 'upstate' to meet the parents of his cute white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams). The parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford, best known as Josh Lyman from ""The West Wing"") and Missy (Catherine Keener, "" Captain Phillips""), are extremely welcoming.

But the weekend coincides with an ""annual gathering"" of family and friends, and events quickly take a left turn into ""The Twilight Zone"", with anti-smoking hypnosis and a bizarre game of Bingo where the win is so substantial that playing becomes a 'no brainer'. Can Chris 'Get Out', with his mind still intact, before it's too late?

This is a really clever script by Peele. The film baits you into thinking this is some redneck-inter-racial-revenge flick, but actually the colour of the skin is almost irrelevant. (Or is it? This angle is left deliciously vague). Some of the filming is spectacularly creepy, with the hypnosis scene being reminiscent to me of the excellent ""Under The Skin"". And never has a teaspoon in a cup of tea been a more devastating weapon.

I seemed to have talked at length this year in this blog on the subject of the ""physics of horror"": the story elements hanging together in a satisfying – albeit sometimes in an unbelievable – way. ""Get Out"" delivers this to perfection, keeping its powder dry until the closing moments of the film before delivering a series of satisfying ""Ah!"" relevatory moments.

While the 'physics' of the film is good the 'biology' is bonkers, featuring a plot point from the terrible first episode of the 3rd season of the original ""Star Trek"" (if you can be bothered to look that up!). But I'll forgive this, parking my incredulity, to salute what I think is one of the year's most novel and impressive low-budget indie horror films.

431,"9/10 | I finally got around to watching this movie. After reading the raving reviews and hearing the hype I was ready to see a good horror flick. Boy was i disappointed. This is neither a horror movie or worth watching. The weak plot is predictable from 20 minutes into the movie. The acting is B movie quality but barely. The written dialog feels like it was written right before a high school freshman English class by a C student who forgot to do their homework. Calling this a horror movie is an insult to the genera. Jordan Peele needs to stick to being a 2nd rate Chappelle and be happy they pay him to do that so called comedy and leave the movie making to the professionals. Don't waste your time with this movie.

432,"7/10 | Some people go to the movies for escapism - for a diversion; a well-deserved break from real life. Then there are those who frequent the cinema for elucidation of deeper truths, or explication unpacking sociopolitical concerns of the time. Somehow (somewhat amazingly), comedy veteran Jordan Peele has crafted a film perfectly geared to appeal to either camp - and as his directorial debut, to boot. Get Out is an unforgettable cinematic experience, tackling subtext almost eerily prescient in the wake of racially-motivated hate crimes, rallies, and dangerously escalating discrimination (both explicit and pervasively subtle. But, lest prospective viewers pass it by as a soapbox diatribe, Peele opts to frame his discourse through an ingeniously un-didactic psychological horror genre lens (think The Stepford Wives crossed with Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, thrown into a Hitchcockian Psycho blender, and churned with a table saw). It's fiendishly eloquent, but almost outlandishly absurdist. And it may be the most clever, bonkers, nail-biting, irreverently ingenious, and grimly fun time at the movies this year.

If that sounds like a confusing cocktail of diametrically opposed elements it is. Yet, somehow, Peele shakes, stirs, and serves the perfect filmic entrée disguised as an aperitif, its roller-coaster ride of emotions and response somehow working seamlessly as an ingeniously homogeneous film. Social satire and the horror genre have long gone hand in hand (in fact, ""We all go a little mad sometimes"" could practically serve as the tagline for the movie that is 2017 ), but Peele finds that true horror lies in the crushing weight of racially-motivated micro-aggressions sprinkled out by the caste of (sometimes) well-intentioned nouveau-liberals doing their best to counteract privilege by being a little too earnest in telling the only African American in the room that they would've voted for Obama for a third term if they could. Peele's satire may be barbed - perhaps too much so not to hit a nerve for some audiences - but its teeth are razor sharp, capturing the intricacies of moments of discomfort almost imperceptible apart from those experiencing them in both hysterical and cringe-worthy detail. His airtight script is succinct but extraordinarily precise, with dialogue rife with clever wordplay (watch for all of the seemingly innocent inclusions of the word ""black"" in innocuous conversation) and coy foreshadowing so intricate the film practically necessitates repeat viewings to drink it all in.

And just when you're engrossed in cackling and cringing under your breath at the savage Act 1 satire, Peele cordially reminds you that you're here watching a horror film - and hits you with no holds barred. Of course, he's never fully let you fully forget it, with a chillingly surreal prologue, and poetic flourishes sneakily maintaining a mood of general unease (protagonists Chris and Rose hit a deer on the way to visiting her parents in the countryside). Some of these are artsy piece of tone-setting foreshadowing. Some are playful red herrings. Some are both, with enough narrative bread crumbs scattered to elicit some painful 'I should've KNOWN!' face-palming in the third act for all but the most eagle-eyed viewers. And none are extraneous, all firmly in service of forwarding both the film's horror tropes and real-life horror intertexts in equal, grim measure. Case in point: ""the sunken place"" - a bout of hypnosis-paralysis Chris is subjected to that has the film at its most claustrophobically terrifying while also providing a crushingly perfect metaphor for feeling consistently beaten down and repressed in a closeted discriminatory culture.

As things take an increasingly chilling turn for the macabre (and Peele's pitch-perfect pacing stews tension to a frantic fever pitch with the effortless nonchalance of a seasoned veteran), Get Out's ultimate, rather sordid, gag is how easy it is to miss the forest for the trees. We find ourselves tempted, alongside Chris, to write off his spine-tingling experiences as paranoia (or the film artistically extrapolating on the experience of racial discrimination), when the reality could simply be that things are, in fact, so much worse than the fears a lifetime of living in 'polite society' has taught him to dismiss as overzealous. The realization starts witty, then becomes almost overwhelmingly sobering. And there's the definitive microcosmic distillation of the film's audience experience as a whole.

Daniel Kaluuya gives an outstanding performance as Chris, establishing a baseline of perfectly affable nonchalance to make the rawness with which he radiates horror at the indignities he's increasingly subjected to all the more harrowing. Still, Kaluuya's work is too sophisticated for rote 'final girl' horror reactions, and a couple of left-turn character choices skirting obvious Hollywood moral choices keep Chris enigmatic enough to remain compelling throughout. Allison Williams is equally terrific, perfecting a peppy charisma with just enough of a highly-strung edge to ensure she equally dodges cliché throughout. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford embody that particular strain of friendliness that is somehow icier and more imperious with every smile to almost unnerving effect, while LilRel Howery is reliably hilarious, pulling double-duty as the film's bombastic comic relief and incredulous moral centre. Finally, Caleb Landry Jones infuses his inherent slithering creepiness into a drunken jock archetype to perfectly unnerving effect, while Stephen Root's warm eloquence provides a welcome foil to the tone-deaf effete posturing threatening to suffocate Chris.

If ever there were a single film to distill the madness of the sociopolitical climate of the past year and make sense of it with acid wit and world-weary humour, it's Peele's unforgettable Get Out. It's psychological horror film as inventive and groundbreaking as it is sadistically playful. It's an unnervingly timely, walloping deconstruction of the intimate intricacies of privilege and prejudice for the ""I'm not racist, but..."" crowd. In short, prospective viewers would do well to follow the advice of its title - Get Out of your house, routine, deeply entrenched mindset, and drink in what hindsight will invariably decree the most illustrative (and fiendishly enjoyable) film of the year.

433,"1/10 | Rant Begins

It's really interesting to me that people are getting triggered and claiming that the movie is extremely racist or something. When Rose says that her father will vote Obama for 3rd time she is not trying to deceive Chris. These people aren't thinking black people as beneath them. Every one of them envies a different point of them. One of them thinks they are fast, one thinks they are cooler in this modern age etc. The point is these people are not neo-Nazis or white supremacists. These people are liberals who would actually vote for Obama again. What this movie criticize is liberal people who, when trying to be ""liberal"" to black people, make things worse. I'm no way claiming that all liberals are like that(obviously) as I am white liberal person but yeah...

Rant Ends

The premise of the movie could be better as there was no need to bring science fiction stuff. They could've just rolled with the ""Let's make them slaves by hypnotism"" because I mean brain exchange didn't really add something to story other than unrealism. Saying that, there was a huge tension until the later parts of the movie. And there was a certain sickness if I had to say? I mean psychological aspect of the movie really creeped me out.

In summary it was an amazing movie who combined horror/comedy/thriller into it and did it well."
434,8/10 | 
435,"10/10 | I loved this movie! This year has been full of sh*t, I have seen very few movies this year that made me walk out of the theatre with a smile on my face. The only movies I have seen this year that I really loved are Split, Logan, and Get Out.

This movie perfectly combines horror, comedy and social commentary. And it is the good kind of social commentary, because its not just saying some stupid sh*t about how racist we are, it actually makes you think and provides some very interesting ideas that really enrich the experience.

The performances are all great. The main actor was great in this film like he was in ""Black Mirror"" and in ""Sicario"". The rest of the actors also did a very good job and the comic relief character was hilarious, I laughed every time that dude was on- screen.

The horror or thriller aspect of this movie was great. There were many scenes in which I was hugging the arm rest out of anxiety. The whole purpose that this white-folks have with ""Chris"" actually terrified me. The only bad thing about the horror is that this movie actually uses the ""someone passed through the hallway and the score becomes loud for a second"" which is really cheap.

The comedy was also pretty good. The director understood that this whole idea had some level of absurdity to it. So he used that to the advantage of the film and created some scenes in which the whole movie theatre was bursting with laughter. I believe that the movie handled pretty well the transitions between the horror and the comedy.

The social commentary is also pretty good. It talks about a whole other level or racism. One in which the characters have passive-aggressive racism. I thought that it really enriched the movie experience.

The whole tone and feeling of the movie is great. You feel awkward when the character feels awkward, and scared when he is scared.

The score and cinematography are great and really made this movie have a much cooler style.

Also, the movie had quite a lot of metaphors and symbols.

Definitely go support this movie. It is really a unique and fun experience."
436,"8/10 | 'Get Out' is a superb piece of horror with sharp, sometimes funny and always interesting social commentary that walks the line between classic horror conventions and a modern, revitalised genre form perfectly. It's an excellent debut from Jordan Peele who moulds his clever tale together with a great cast, interesting camera-work and a welcome dose of heavy tension and menace.

First of all, go see this film as blindly as you can. Teaser trailers are acceptable, anything else could ruin or spoil the moment. I made the effort to go in relatively blind through part laziness and part active ignorance, avoiding critic's reviews and switching off the radio if people started talking about it. The premise alone should be enough to interest most people and Peele's name attached to the writing and directing should be able to persuade most sceptics. That said, whether you like or dislike horror, make the time for this one.

The cast is all around excellent though special praise must go to Daniel Kaluuya who, despite the temptations of genre, keeps his acting naturalistic, completely believable and watchable. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford also deserve special mentions for their parts, as do Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel for their creepy turns. Peele doesn't let the cast carry the film however with some interesting, creative and above all else unnerving camera-work and great writing throughout. Lest we forget that Peele wrote, directed and produced this.

Beyond everything Peele has succeeded in balancing the genre demands of his piece with the social commentary he puts forth. There is a danger with any horror film that the social issues at hand overwhelm the story or that the story and plot dampen any wider concerns to nearly nothing. There is interesting and at times genuinely uncomfortable moments created by the issues our main character faces and situations he deals with. Peele has got the balance spot on and the film is also helped by moments of well timed comic relief.

Debuts are always a double edged sword which half the time leave you feeling underwhelmed and the other half overwhelmed, setting up inevitable disappointments for whatever follows up. Peele has proved himself a skilled and inventive director who can tackle complex and fascinating subject matter in a horrific fashion as much as he can in his comedy. He has said he has many more stories of 'social demons' to come over the next ten or so years. I am looking forward to them already."
437,8/10 | 
438,"8/10 | I decided to go watch the movie after I saw the high reviews about it and when I went to the theater I was ultimately enjoyed. everything about the movie is amazing , interesting and exciting. From the very beginning you can feel the strange setting , the strange reactions from the white family, you feel that there's something wrong and this makes you more concentrated in the movie and not feeling bored at all. The movie really takes you from the very beginning and I like that kind of movies which has fast temp. Then the second part of the movie when everything is revealed you can sympathize with the hero as if you're him . you really feel sorry for him , you feel like you really want to help and that makes you more concentrated and following the afterwards scenes where you need to know more and keep thinking how he will react to his situations .what will happen next and all that sort of questions keep coming on your mind.

In the end you can see all the pieces of the puzzle coming together and you began to connect the scenes with themselves.

On the other hand and in spite of that this movie is a horror movie but there is a very high comedy scenes in the movie that would really make you laugh so loud and this was very very very interesting.

I really enjoyed the whole movie and I'm really so thankful to the writer & director Jordan Peele because he really made my day and because this is the best movie so far in 2017. Really I do appreciate his hard work and I'm really looking forward to all his next projects.

Last thing I gave it 9 out of 10 just because I wished if the movie could tell us more about the stories of the other victims . This depends on the viewers some people like it to be left like that for our imaginations and some people like me love it when more details in more scenes are shot and added to the movie .

Go watch Get Out all the people"
439,10/10 | 
440,"9/10 | Get out is the directorial debut by comedian Jordan Peele from the comedy central show ""Key and Peele"" as well as Mad TV. Unlike his work that I previously mentioned this is a horror film so it was really interesting to see what he would do with this movie.

So what's the story? Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) goes on a trip with his girlfriend Rose to meet her parents. Only thing is he is black and her parents are from a rural suburb and he's worried they won't care for them being in an interracial relationship. At first everything seems okay. The parents welcome Chris in open arms however ,the longer they are at this meet the parents trip, things become stranger and stranger, as the parents gradually begin acting more sinister and hostile and every person that works at this house is black, further adding to the creepiness of this whole situation.

Let's talk about the dialogue in this movie, every single word that is said has some sort of meaning and commentary behind it. If you watch the trailers you'll see the Dad using stereotypical black slang and accents when speaking to Chris in an effort to relate to him. Every one is trying insanely hard to prove that they aren't racist, and many other things that make the viewer feel more uneasy the more they talk.

The good thing is the subtext in this movie isn't completely reliant on dialogue the TV's look very much like the old style ones from the 1950's, the architecture of the house is colonial style like a plantation home and so much detail put in this movie that it's insane. You really get the feeling that Jordan Peele put a lot of effort and care into crafting this insane horrific world.

Also the pacing is very well done. It starts off fairly relaxed. Not boring, just relaxed. Then the further the movie goes along the more intense it gets. The film lulls you in such a way that you don't even notice how drastically the tone changes over time until the movie is over and you realize you've been on the edge of your seat for over 90 minutes.

Despite the film being an extremely intense experience Jordan Peele does manage to sprinkle in some of his special brand of humor when the tension needs to ease up at times. There were times when I would be scared out of my mind and then in the very next scene I'd be rolling in my seat laughing.

You might take a look at this and think if you're a white person ""man I don't wanna watch this movie, I don't wanna feel like some monster simply cause I'm white."" And to that I say get over yourself just because some white people suck doesn't automatically mean you do. With that being said this movie takes a subject that can be very divisive and uses carefully crafted suspense blended with humor to bring the viewer in who may have an entirely different background from the main character as far as race relations go and generate sympathy for problems one may not have to deal with on a regular basis. Me personally, I'm a white man from a rural SOUTHERN suburb in a predominantly white town, and unfortunately I have encountered many people with racist attitudes in my lifetime. And yet I didn't feel attacked for my background or anything like that.

While I did mention everything having a purpose, and extreme attention to detail there are certain parts that while scary at the time don't really have a lasting impact on the story as a whole. The thing is though this is something you don't realize until you're in the car on your way home and you think to yourself wait a second! Really that's my only knock about this movie the story is intriguing, the dialogue and scenery are rich with social commentary, it's well paced, just certain things don't really pay off as well as they could from time to time. Go see this movie. If you consider yourself a horror fan you owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially since good horror is in such short supply recently.

And I'm gonna give Get Out, a 9/10.

441,"1/10 | Jordan Peele's first feature film offers a worryingly bleak reflection of race relations, segregation and stereotyping in what will undoubtedly be one of 2017's most troubling (and terrifying) films. A psychological thriller dressed up as classic horror, the sense of impending doom created right from the off - with an African American man walking through a white suburban neighborhood at night - leaves you with a sense of dread but also numbness; and, to an extent, helpless voyeurism.

Though preposterous at times, the twists and turns taken (and sometimes alluded to, but then swiftly negated) do leave you guessing as to a potential solution to the many problems presented to both our main character, Chris (brilliantly played by Daniel Kaluuya) and best friend, Rod (Lil Rel Howery); both of whom appear to represent specific - yet broad - archetypes of modern day black men in America. The overall eeriness and gloom of Peele's film is sometimes - intentionally- undercut by the voices of certain characters for comedic effect; yet this could be seen as another very real world commentary on the rubbishing of institutionalized racism which is still so prevalent in modern day society. Whilst not perfect, Get Out is a bold, daring and unflinching portrait of the 21st century racial landscape."
442,"1/10 | The expectancy dead. Try to be terror or comedy, it can not get either! The movie is simplistc left-wing positioning: Black is strong, beautiful, good people and victims. White is weak, ugly, treacherous and exploiters! Simplistic and unhappy view! It could have been deeper and a little less prejudiced. However, from a stereotyped political view, one could not expect anything else!

443,"9/10 | It's been about one whole year since Jordan Peele's Get Out was unleased onto cinemas and I've only just managed to see it! I call myself a seasoned horror fan but why on Earth did it take me so long to see a four-time Oscar nominated horror film? You know it has to be special when the Academy (who famously shun all genre movies) consider giving it a gong for Best Picture. After all, Get Out is the first all-out horror film to be nominated in the category since The Exorcist in 1973. Unless you decide to count the likes of Black Swan and The Silence of the Lambs which have elements of horror but are no where near as obvious as this film.

Is it all that superior then? Personally I think we've seen better recently in films such as The Witch and It Follows, but there's no denying that it's a cut above the rest. It's certainly far more intelligent than most films nowadays, which the Academy miraculously realised after awarding it an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay last night. It follows black British star Daniel Kaluuya as he goes to meet his white girlfriend's parents at their large middle-class home. Everything seems fine a first but gradually things start to take a sinister turn as some very white guests arrive and seem to almost close in on our black hero. To say anything else would be to ruin the terrific surprises in store, I went in knowing almost nothing about the plot and was certainly all the better for it.

Get Out takes a simple horror movie premise and turns it into a thoughtful and scarily plausible satire about racism. What's nice is that it doesn't shove it down our throats in a ham-fisted way like say, Mother! (which I loved, I must say) but there's stuff for keener viewers to dig in to. It never patronises its audience and is always interested in building up a sense of paranoia and suspense around a likable protagonist who we can all root for. It also manages to provide an exciting third act which manages to satisfy and thrill in equal measure.

It's difficult to believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film. The technical competence is pretty outstanding, although he has had plenty of experience starring in film and TV before so he must've learned something about being behind the camera whilst being in front of it! He shows great flair and vision behind the camera, always remaining focused and expertly building tension. Where most directors would go in for the heavy-handed approach, Peele uses subtlety and restraint. Even the barmy revelation is presented with such confidence, that you don't doubt the logic for a second.

Get Out might not be the ground-breaking classic you were hoping for, but it's certainly a fine horror film with enough comedy to comfortably cleanse your pallet. Despite always having its tongue in cheek, it carries an important message about liberal racism and does an excellent job at making the audience feel what it's like to be a black man in modern America. The ending perhaps could've been less predictable and convenient, but Get Out offers plenty of hidden riches in repeated viewings."
444,"10/10 | I don't know why people thought this movie was going to be racist. It's a great movie. Jordan Peele has crafted a movie so complexly amazing that it kept me on the edge of my sit the whole time. It keeps you guessing throughout the movie of what is going to happen next and it might prove you wrong. It definitely gets 10 stars or 10/10.

445,"1/10 | Let me just start out by saying that I am going to be a little biased about the racist twist to it... (belonging to a .'untouchable' hierarchy in the Hindu system of 'race'). Just Wikipedia the 'varna (Hinduism)' if you want to learn more. Anyways, the plot was intriguing and gripping. The actors played out well. The character development was superb. The ending was too pleasing to be real, although I must say I enjoyed every bit of it. I must also admit it was a bit racist though.. but I can understand ... The intended purpose for it. Go watch it.. leaving aside the 'racist' tone that it surely has.. it won't let you down. 8/10 for me... Easily...

446,"7/10 | In an era where actual good horror movies are pretty rare, Get Out gives me a little hope that this genre isn't dead just yet. This isn't just another series of jump scares with terrible acting and a stale plot. This movie doesn't make you jump, it will genuinely make you feel uncomfortable for the most part. I'll be honest, this is one of the only horror movies that actually made me feel sick because of how creepy and uncomfortable it is to watch. The first two acts are great and very well written but the third act and the ending are both a little silly and don't seem to fit with the rest. Overall though, Get Out is certainly a must watch for horror fans or people who just want to watch something different. Oh and Daniel Kaluuya is fantastic!

This is NOT a cheap spoof movie!

This movie is unique unlike most horror movies nowadays. There is suspense, mystery, violence and thought compelling moments.

It is legitimately scary, while facing cultural issues in America today.

You won't find any cliché ghosts, or haunted objects in this movie.

Instead, you will get an enjoyable experience of trying to figure out what is REALLY going on and who is who they say they are.

By the climax of the movie I found myself truly impressed with how absolutely brutal it became.

Top notch horror movie."

453,"7/10 | A film that takes you to the roller coaster ride of lightness and darkness. Get out is strongly edited yet beautiful piece of work. A simple story as it seems in starting minutes is whole dark until its's end.

PLOT: Rose Armitage ( Allison Williams) takes her boyfriend Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) for a weekend her home. All things slowly starts to go haywire for chris as he meets rose's family.

Coming to the actors everything was great. Although Daniel seemed a bit meh in a starting scenes but till the end he was at his best. He truely deserved a nominations this year. Marcus handerson in his small role was effective. so all the actors.

best thing about the movie was its of background score specially during the starting sequence.

I will simply rate this movie 10 on 10 for its effective direction, strong writing and acting performances."
454,"7/10 | This film tells the story of a African American man who travels to see his Caucasian girlfriend's parents in their house in the countryside. Though they seem to profusely welcome him, there is something not right about the whole setup. Soon his hunch turns into a deadly reality.

""Get Out"" has a rather slow pacing to start with, as the story develops and the stage is set. The racial topic is brought up a little to often to be comfortable, but soon the reason for these strange encounters become apparent. The story is thrilling, and there is quite a bit of mystery in the film. The ending is unnerving and unexpected. The audience were very engaged with the film; gasps and applause were quite frequent towards the ending climax. It is an enjoyable thriller.

455,"8/10 | A reality check of mine is always: how does X or Y sound when a religion or race in the statement/book/movie is reversed. This film could NOT have been made, if the black hero had been white and the white villains had been black. It is so stereotyped. Don't get me wrong, it was an intelligent film and a deep, deserved critique of our modern society. It was well-filmed and a good watch throughout. It's just: Leni Riefenstahl also made a cinematically good documentary about some or the other Nazi Olympic games and that is rightly denounced as being racist. This film is a Leni Riefenstahl. Only it has the white guys in the stereotypical villain role. And suddenly its all okay. We're allowed to be racist about white people and call it art. Uhuh. A good film. I enjoyed it. But: No, deeply, disturbing and racist.

457,"10/10 | I surprisingly liked this movie a lot more than I thought I would! I knew from the clips and trailers I have seen that it was going to be well done and well acted. And it was. Especially from Daniel Kaluuya. Superb acting. Even a lot of the smaller characters had certain moments where they shined. It won the best screenplay award so I had that in mind while watching and I have to agree it was great, the story grabs you from the start, kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what the heck is going on. But don't get me wrong. It's not action packed. It's a slow burn mind game and it was pretty fun trying to figure it all out. Don't watch clips or trailers! It was nice going in not knowing much. It was rated R because the story needed it to be, not just because it wanted to be, which I always appreciate. The soundtrack was pretty cool but not that unique for this type of movie. The directing was pretty great and the story was told very well. You may be asking yourself ""Why is Chris surprised he liked it? Is it cause it's about black people made by black people and he's racist and doesn't think black people can make good movies?!"" Uh no. Ha! That's what the Social Justice Warriors want you to think. Which is exactly why I was surprised I liked it! I feel like the Oscars and lots of the media praised this movie so much and acted like it was the ""best movie of our generation"" and acted like it was SO IMPORTANT for black people. It made me think it was going to be filled with political and racist preaching. But I watched it with an open mind and it wasn't like that! I know it had metaphors and other things throughout but it wasn't in your face or preachy. It was just a good thriller that you can either take at face value and enjoy or you can think really deep about and get social issues. It lets you have that choice. That's what surprised me and I'm glad. So if you want a good thriller with twists and ""what the heck""s, or if you're racist against white people and want to see them get it, Get Out is the film for you!"
458,"7/10 | For the vast majority of this movie you will feel like - what the hell is this extremely racist crap? Literally every conversation throughout the movie has a classic racist cliché vibe, this movie is extremely derogatory towards black people, i would assume there were many easily triggered people who walked out of the theater on premiere.

Apart from the insane display of racism the suspense was pretty decent, not too much violence, just tense atmosphere. Overall, the movie is just fine and has a very original story, have not seen anything quite like this, just the execution could have been much better. The ending is definitely extremely surprising, seeing how racist the whole premise of this movie was.

An interesting movie worth watching just because it is different and has an interesting outcome, which was completely anti-cliché.

460,"7/10 | When i saw the trailer I was expecting it to be a dark movie with a dark ending.

Surprisingly it was a fun watch, the movie lived upto its mark and till the end it keeps you fully involved in what is happening.

The actors nicely played their parts and till the end you will keep on guessing only to be surprised.

A must watch and has been a fun watch for me as well. Not a cinema movie though, I would rather watch this movie at home with a bag of popcorn.

461,"10/10 | This movie had lots of suspense from beginning to end, great acting, and a great story. That is all I have to say about the movie, but IMDb has a STUPID rule forcing people to post 5 lines worth of text, as if they were professional movie reviewers. For this matter, I will fill the rest with unrelated content:

465,"10/10 | PROS: The acting in GET OUT was phenomenal, the best acting I've seen in this decade so far. The genuine fear the main character had was chilling, and the insanity that every other character played was impeccable. The acting, in my opinion, is what carried the film. Most of the other parts of what makes a film worth watching were very OK. The tension in the movie was good. This portion could've been much worse, but it had a very unique style to it. When you watch as many horror movies as I have you anticipate a certain style of rising action, but this film came at it from a different perspective. It wasn't my style, but I could understand and appreciate it from a very technical level.

CONS: With any horror movie there will be some cons. The ending in GET OUT felt very unfinished. To me it felt like the director couldn't come up with an ending as good as the rest of the film, so instead he settled for this very mediocre finale. But when you put that all aside there was one flaw that bothered me more than the rest. GET OUT was marketed as a ""big horror film"" or the ""most intense horror of 2017"" and these statements frustrated me because after watching the film it was quite obviously not a horror film, more or less a psychological thriller. I went in to this movie expecting one thing and preparing myself for that thing but in turn it delivered a completely different message. Was the movie good? 100% yes, but these negatives just stuck out like a sore thumb.

466,"10/10 | Reading the comments here, it's clear that the people who did not enjoy the film felt uncomfortable because the movie played on racial fear. I loved this movie. Suspsense, comedy and horror at it's best! I was asking myself , if there was anything I didn't like or thought that could be better about this movie.... and you know what... I couldn't think of anything. Jordan really did his thing with Get Out

468,"8/10 | Get Out is one of the most entertaining movies I have watched in years because of the well crafted mystery, gradual but sure build up of tension through music and direction, and appealing lead character. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, offers some fun scares, and is socially provocative in a good way. I would watch this movie again, and highly recommend it for those who can overlook the racial component.

469,"10/10 | The movie does a great job of subtly portraying some of the everyday stereotypes faced by the African-American community - from being asked to produce an ID in the middle of the road, to so-called liberal Whites going out of their way to mention that they loved Tiger Woods and had voted for Obama.

What worked for me was that there was no banal supernatural element to bring in the 'horror' component, but something more realistic from our day-to-day lives.

*** Potential spoilers ahead ***

The ending was pathetic though - it seemed that the script-writers ran out of ideas. A happy ending is okay if executed properly, but random coincidences, no. It would have been a fitting end to a horror/thriller if the police officer from before had arrived on the scene to arrest our hero, who's fingerprints were on the hand-gun with the double-faced girlfriend aptly playing the role of the victim.

*** End of potential spoilers ***

Anyway, makes up for a great one-time watch thanks to the powerful acting, a masterful build-up, and a (90%) strong script."
470,"8/10 | Awesome flick! Super creepy, freaky, scary, and super funny too! The plot is totally whacked out, but it works and I was as scared as I've been in ""regular"" horror flicks! And Marcus Henderson steals all of his scenes and is absolutely hysterical! The other actors are top notch too, and the story is superb! And two of the songs in here are completely used to maximum freaky deaky effect! I'm definitely watching this one again!

471,"8/10 | Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a young African American photographer whose white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) wants to take him to meet her parents, psychotherapist mother Missy (Catherine Keener) and neurosurgeon father Dean (Bradley Whitford). Chris is worried that Rose hasn't told them that he is black, but she assures him that they won't be the slightest bit bothered about his race. As it happens, his colour turns out to be the least of his worries as his growing suspicions that there is something very sinister afoot at the Armitage house turn out to be well founded.

Not long after Chris arrives at Rose's parent's house, matters begin to get weird, Mr and Mrs Armitage's affable behaviour a little too perfect, while their home help, maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel) and groundsman Walter (Marcus Henderson), act in a manner that can best be described as freakin' bizarre. A party for friends and family introduces more strange characters into the mix, most of whom are politely racist. Something clearly isn't right about this picture, but the viewer is wisely kept as much in the dark as Chris, while director Jordan Peele exhausts all of the possible paranoia/conspiracy angles. All the strings are pulled together in the final act, in which Peele reveals the outlandish truth, going for tension and scares, with just a little gore for good measure.

As a Caucasian, I guess I could take offence at the film's portrayal of white folk, who, with no exception, are evil bastards who covet the physically superior body of the African American. Instead, I just found the whole crazy notion too absurd to take seriously."
472,"8/10 | Get Out focuses on a black man named Chris while he travels with his girlfriend to meet her very nice but very suspicious parents. After Chris is introduced to the house he sees some disturbing imagery and weird acts that make him think something more darker is present, but what exactly? First off, everybody in the movie is great. This film also offers some astounding visual horror. I didn't expect this to be a comedy, but when you get the comedy it really pays off.

Get Out actually touches some of the social issues that are in our world such as racism and it does it in a very smart way. The soundtrack is also pretty great and works very well with what is going on in the movie. This isn't a flaw but there are some scenes that were scary but it didn't really make any sense, but fortunately the big twist explains why that weird thing happened. I won't spoil it, but the twist is very satisfying and is very unsettling to even think about.

In the end, Get Out was a very intense but also in a sort of sense serious with things that happen in our community and excellently blends horror, comedy, and social commentary in one original and creative film. A+ or 10/10"
473,"9/10 | This is, hands down the first masterpiece of 2017. It is definitely not a masterpiece of horror because it isn't a horror movie. It is a thriller with bits of brilliant comedy infused in. This film has a very important message on race and it really speaks on race as it is still a very serious problem in America. But beyond the very relevant themes, how is it as a movie? It is flawless. If you are looking for a great thriller this is the film for you. The performances are all around incredible but the most impressive aspect hands down is Jordan Peele's writing and direction. His vision is very well realized and it's obvious that the studio really didn't give him much interference which is a very good thing because his vision was the best. Seeing how serious he took this project really makes me excited to see what he can do in the future. I won't spoil anything, but the ending, and the twist, is pure perfection. I loved every moment of this film and although it might not be as scary as I had hoped, that's not really the point in my opinion. And in the end...

PROS: Everything

CONS: none

My Rating: 10/10"
474,"9/10 | Not since a Hitchcock have I seen such mastery. As a filmmaker, it's very difficult to sit thru a film without a few eye rolls, a question of writing, the shot, the acting. My producer friend tells me ""Just enjoy the damn movie!"" Well, with this one - I was lost in it. It was subtle, well shot, extremely well directed. Loved the writing, the premise. The tension was palpable. The sound mix was spot on, and well balanced. Even the scary parts were done with class. Gotta see it.

475,"8/10 | have seen this much acclaimed flick I still don't know what to think about it. It clocks in over 90 minutes and it's all about situations and talking and that should be boring for a horror but somehow I kept watching to see what it's all about and I agree, halfway you get it. It's all clear what this is about and the opening sequence do explains itself throughout the flick.

And the opening sequence is so really well done, even as it doesn't gave any blood still it gives you the creeps. The sound and the prowler, it all works.

But it really asks a lot of the viewer to sit throughout this flick. It has awkward moments and you really do get into characterization that you want to know how this flick will ends. i can't spoil but it's really well written because one moment I couldn't see coming concerning the daughter.

Is it worth seeing, well, if you want to see a slasher or a nasty flick forget it. It's pure survival midst a strange family. the story did remind me of Faceless (1987) somehow. Only for horror buffs who dig a lot of conversation and can wait until the last reel to see the bloody stuff.

476,"9/10 | Made an account just to rate this movie and if you ask why I rated it 10/10, it is because of the following reasons (no spoilers):

1. I've read the brief description, thought it was just a ""racism"" movement movie, was really making my mind if I should watch this, after it, I just can't look at other horror movies/thrillers without comparing it to this masterpiece. 2. Acting, actors fit perfectly with roles, every single one of them. It is just amazing. 3. The story was well executed. Perfectly. It follows the viewers line of thinking, and not some ""Hey, let's explore this because we're original like that."" story like in 99% of the today's horror movies. 4. NOT a single jumpscare, but some scenes, boy, will they keep you on your toes. The quality I always look in a horror movie. If you jumpscare me, go away. If you set the mood so tight and so right... it's perfect. A perfect horror movie. 5. Again, the story. It's just too good. And the actors fit them so well, it is not even funny.. So hard to describe it without spoiling anything, but guys, it's worth the 102mins. Trust me.

Oh, and there's a funny black dude, like always. Good guy."
477,"8/10 | I went to see this film knowing nothing about it, not even its genre. I was given some clues during the trailers before the movie. First I was forced to enter a room with a young girl looking out the window only to turn around and suddenly reveal to my shock and horror the she was a very loud CGI monster. Then I was made to watch some kids go into a dark scary room filled with water which was suddenly and very loudly a clown-doll's swimming pool... or something.

And so I discovered Get Out is a horror movie. Get Out, however, does not follow a formulaic build up of jump scares and rehashed imagery to create it's tension and tone. It does this through meshing flawless cinematography with brilliant acting, music, lighting and script. Furthermore, the movie has plenty of commentary on the modern and historical faces of racism which it explores masterfully whilst never insulting its audience by being too brash.

Every shot in this movie feels carefully crafted to create tension and unease. From the single uncut shot of the opening scene to the unnerving choice of extreme close ups during dialogue. So often the choice of shot subverts what you would expect for the scene. Characters being warmly greeted by family is shown in a long shot giving a sense of detachment and that feeling of being watched. You are also as acutely aware of what is not in frame during the film as you are of what is in frame and this only adds to the ever mounting suspense. Combine all this with an eerie soundtrack (if a little cliché) and you have a film that feels organically creepy and not manufactured.

Furthermore, the film has genuine moments of comedy, which is unsurprising given its director's background. But the occasional comedic shifts in the movies tone never felt clunky. Well rounded and well fleshed out characters meant that the humour felt like it came naturally to scenes.

To go with the meticulous directing is a strong script. The film reveals information at an appropriate rate, the pacing is never tedious or rushed and most importantly, character motivations never feel inauthentic. Importantly, there wasn't that ""I'm going to stop escaping to go open that door where the eerie music is coming from. I hope that loud, jumpy, stabby thing that's been chasing me isn't there"" scene that pulls you from the movie.

This film is as intelligent as it is gripping. It will disturb and entertain you whilst viewing it. It will provoke thought during and after. It will continue to grow on you long after watching. Jordan Peele has put together a wholly original film that feels fresh, authentic and most of all meticulously crafted. I thought hard about what rating to give it and ended up figuring if I don't give a film this unique and this well made a 10, then what's the point in having a score go up to 10. Do yourself and those interested in original and well made cinema a favour by supporting this film and seeing it on the big screen."

480,"8/10 | I saw this one recently and enjoyed it...

Get Out is a very clever horror film that also contains some thought-provoking subtext about race relations, just below its surface. It also has a number of good laughs in it, so it's bending a few genre conventions here, methinks. It's an entertaining genre film, but it also has some social commentary in it too, so it works on more than one level.

All the performances are strong, but Daniel Kaluuya is particularly effective playing a boyfriend caught up in a scenario that isn't entirely what it appears to be on the surface. Catherine Keener is also very memorable in this one, playing a mom who might be more than just a typical nurturing mother. But there's more than one memorable performance in this movie; the entire cast is very good.

Anyway, thumbs up from me. Get Out is one of the best horror flicks I've seen this year, and it's definitely worth checking out. This is Jordan Peele's first film as a director, and it will be interesting to see what he does next."
481,"8/10 | Wow. Just wow. About time Hollywood had the balls to put out something like this. Bravo! This is the kind of movie you want to watch again right after watching it because of how new and innovating it is. This isn't the same recycled horror film you've seen a million times before, and that is why this film performed as well as it did. I'm guessing you know the plot already. A white girl takes her black boyfriend to meet her parents and the boyfriend notices an above average amount of racial awareness and overall creepiness going on with her family. And I'll leave it at that. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie without knowing anything else about it. I can't wait to watch it again. I think this film does an outstanding job of letting film goers feel what a black person or any minority feels like in the United States, at times. You already know this is getting a ten out of ten from me.

482,"8/10 | Racism is Real? Get Out.

If you are looking for a thrilling movie that simultaneously attacks today's controversies, Get Out is a must see movie. This newly- released horror film has been all the rage. I had heard many positive reviews before seeing this movie, so my expectations were relatively high. I was expecting a somewhat scary film; a thrilling story of a boyfriend whose girlfriend's family has a plan to destroy him. What I was not expecting was a thought-provoking film that cleverly confronts the ever-present issue of racism. Director Jordan Peele has discovered a way to throw a controversial topic into a horror and comedy and impressively wrap it all into one. I found myself laughing out loud as Lil Rel Howery, who plays a TSA agent that is best friends with the main character, comes to the rescue to save his best friend. ""Man, I told you not to go into that house,"" he says at the end. This film includes many classic horror scenes and gore. But this film causes viewers to take a look at racism in a terrifying but real way. This movie is an original; Jordan Peele does something never before done in the movie industry. Although I was slightly upset with the abrupt ending to this movie, I couldn't be more impressed with the overall film. If you believe in reverse racism and are a white lives matter advocate, get out of the showing of this movie."
483,1/10 | 
484,"1/10 | Jordan Peele, of Key and Peele fame, kicks off his directorial career with a genre-swapping film that depicts a young black man's ill-fated journey to his white girlfriend's parents' house. There he finds that all is not as it should be, and that his prospective in-laws may not be as normal as they appear to be.

The atmosphere of 'Get Out' is one of the very best you can create in a film. Spine-chillingly creepy at times, with foreshadowing and acting that works better than any jump scare, and at other times raucously enjoyable, witty, and entertaining, it succeeds across all fronts. Daniel Kaluuya makes for a relatable and likable protagonist that the audience can root for, whilst Lil Rel Howery as his erstwhile and foul-mouthed friend is huge fun, and one of the standout comedy characters in recent years. The parents, played note-perfectly by Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, represent a ramped-up version of the so-called 'West Wing liberals', the type of people who purport to be progressive and welcoming, but inadvertently make black people uncomfortable with racial stereotypes and microaggressions.

The film ends up being one of the best cinematic examples of presenting race in a long time. Perfectly capturing the zeitgeisty racial divide in modern America, its depiction of the daily struggles faced by minorities is remarkable, and one of the scariest aspects of the film is how plausible and true to life it all is (up to a point). The satire is delivered flawlessly, and Peele deserves all the plaudits he is receiving for the astounding first-time effort he has made here. Combining his fresh, razor-sharp and highly witty script with the subtle yet 100% effective direction, he has made a film that is not only one of the best satires of modern times, but also an incredibly enjoyable horror-comedy.

It is not quite accurate to label 'Get Out' a true horror film. It is certainly scary, mainly stemming from the experience Kaluuya's Chris has to go through, which transports the viewer into his shoes and leaves us on edge throughout the buildup. However, if you go in expecting a Halloween-ready horror film that will rival the horror classics, you will inevitably be disappointed. It is more of a horror-style thriller, with its dynamic plot taking the audience on a twisty and unpredictable journey that lets the viewer piece it together whilst going along.

Overall, 'Get Out' is probably the best film of the first few months of 2017. Being fresh, innovative, thrilling, scary, and sharply scripted, Jordan Peele's debut is promising and it's an important film for the issue of race. 91/100."

486,"1/10 | I will not spoil the story for new viewers here but i enjoyed the way that it subverted genres and expectations. It is amusing seeing that some reviewers are calling it 'racist', such comments show that it worked. This is a must see movie that entertains and covers serious issues. Bradley Whitford is excellent and its great seeing a black actor as lead rather than prop to a white hero.

487,"10/10 | Get Out is a new horror comedy from one of the minds behind the hit series ""Key and Peele"", although this movie is less of a comedy and more of a straight up suspense film. I thought this film was fantastic. It was always apparent from the direction of ""Key and Peele"" that Both Jordan and Keegan-Michael understood directing very well and could easily satirize bad directing, but I never knew how that would translate over onto a serious attempt at making a film. That is until this movie. From the moment Childish Gambino's ""redbone"" began playing I knew I was in for something special. This is the best first film from a director I have seen since last years ""The Witch"". It knows how to create suspense through things like mood and score rather than overused constant jump scares and other weak techniques. This film utilizes a foreboding string score to ratchet up the tension and it never really lets up. The acting is also amazing. Each actor does a perfect job of either portraying fear or lynchian esque creepiness. Just watch the ""conversation"" that takes place between the movies main character and the house maid. Listen to the score. Notice the low , up-close camera angle. ""Get Out"" knows what it is doing and how to put its audience on edge. In fact, both people I watched this film with were grabbing onto me and refusing to let go pretty much the entire time. It does have issues that hold it back. There is a scene of horrible CGI fire that made me and my girlfriend both say out loud something along the lines of ""wow that looks like dogsh@t"". There is another scene that makes no sense, and without spoiling I'll just say it has to do with an open door leading to a bunch of photographs that have no reason of ever being so blatantly left around. Finally, the ending happens too fast and while it is oh so satisfying, it blows its load too soon and quickly. Don't let any of that deter you from seeing this movie though, whether you are a horror fan or not. Whether you are black or white. Liberal or Conservative. This film is for anybody who can appreciate film or at least loves being scared. I give it an 8.5/10 and it currently stands as the best film of 2017"
488,"8/10 | Wife wanted to go see it, and i'm always down to see a horror flick in theater so i said ""heck yes lets go."" I went in expecting racial parents terrorize black boyfriend. OK, could be fun. Turns out there is a much more interesting and even a sci-fi premise going on here that really had me enjoying this movie quite a bit by the end. The first half does a good job of setting the stage and gets you thinking ""ok what the hell is going on here"" which is exactly what the main actor is going through - well played.

As for the racial bias against whites - as a white male i'm not feeling it on this. If you watch the movie to completion this goes way beyond mere racism, and more into sick sci-fi. That said the build up to this point is full of comedic racial tension that all but the most grumpy white and black folks can laugh at. This makes the usual thriller build up that more entertaining.

Overall for the genre this was excellent and easily worth a theater outing. 9/10"
489,"1/10 | 'Get Out' is a well-balanced blend of horror and comedy. While it is consistently eerie, intriguing and suspenseful, the comedy manages to compliment the tone, which is hard to achieve. For example, the comic relief character TSA Agent Rod is actually funny and a stand- out, which is uncommon, but it should be noted that every actor in this film is stellar, particularly Daniel Kaluuya. Director Jordan Peele ('Key & Peele' and 'Keanu') displays a strong influence from classic horror/slasher films, but shows enough originality (black brainwashing, the ""sunken place"") to stand out from other horror directors. He achieves this by subverting the horror genre, having a black male as the lead in peril, instead of a virginal babysitter.

The theme of racism is strong and ballsy; Peele's tactic of having white middle-class liberals (you) as the villain, the movie reflects back on the audience to chilling results (like 'Black Mirror', only much better). The film remains accessible throughout despite the heavy, ""in your face"" race theme – I felt the metaphor lacked subtlety, which was a small issue. The ending was good if a little too small in scale ('Hot Fuzz' was better at this) and the twist was surprising and had a strong build-up (""get the keys!""). The film was let down by not having a big scare-factor – this was more creepy than scary and long-time horror fans might be disappointed with the slightly unnecessary jump scare cues. I would describe 'Get Out' as creative and engaging, and awesome to watch with a cinema audience (I can't remember an ordinary packed screening room clapping before)."
490,"1/10 | This is not a horror movie - there is very little blood and guts, and the ""horror"" elements could easily have been in any Hitchcock film.

That said, it's a lighthearted satirical take on race relations.

There are some very effective creepy parts. There are some hilarious parts - some awkward humor as white residents of the neighborhood say racist things while explaining to the protagonist how they're not racist. And some just funny parts with the comic relief character.

Things it's not:

really serious

a ""masterpiece""

a ""horror"" movie

""racist"" as some reviewers try to claim"
491,"1/10 | This review of Get Out is spoiler free

**** (4/5)

AS IT HAPPENS, there is indeed no perfect time for Jordan Peele's directorial debut to come out. In a year when we've already had Hidden Figures, Loving, Fences and the Best Picture winning Moonlight taking their challenging turns in showing how racist America used to be. Peele who's also lived with racism decided to input all them racist thoughts into the incredible Get Out. The social commentary is cleverly crafted, too, not only adapting racism to the 21st century but also giving hilarious moments especially from the scene stealingly funny LilRel Howery who thinks that Chris is being hypnotized into a sex slave, cleverly changing the narrative but also giving laugh out loud moments. The film's design is purely intended to lift the façade of post-racial America and showcase the ugliness still lying beneath; the astounding thing about it is he not only sharply manages to craft the film with racism but crafting it so that he even made a hugely entertaining thriller with horror elements.

Still it's not an easy watch for the modern audience, given that a young African-American man as a target for this goes without saying horrific, but incredibly well. The young African-American man here is Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) who's in a relationship with a young Caucasian woman Rose (Allison Williams), he's particularly nervous having never met her parents. He gets the idea that they're going to hate him, while on the other hand trying to make him a slave. When they arrive her parents immediately take a liking to him, they become instant friends. This is when the film changes pace, Chris notices that aren't quite right with this average American family estate he takes a certain notice to the African-American janitor and housemaid helping on the house - perhaps hinting that this family are stuck in the past.

Peele makes us wait for even an immediate thrill to take place, to perhaps give us a jolt, but it's as while before this happens yet when it does the Goosebumps are relentless it's only a second but it's effective. Given that the tension slowly rises and it keeps our fixed gaze on the screen. Keeps the audience on edge as if tied to the seat, wondering what's going to happen next.

What follows are relentless thrills and jump scares as Chris is scared lifeless, he's hypnotized to quit smoking which takes to bigger effect later, and he's left to a moment when he has to escape after being brutally warned to ""Get out"" by a fellow African-American in post-trance state. Peele amps the tension up to 11 here giving no boundaries as to how far he'll take this. The secret reveal takes a turn for the worse when Chris finds that his girlfriend isn't who she says she is – adding to the rising shock factor.

Slowly turning into an escape movie when Chris is hypnotized he has to escape from a cell-like room. It has moments of Stepford Wives and there is a deer antler impalement reference from Silent Night, Deadly Night. This confident debut is never boring, it's hilarious, it's thrilling and it's original. Peele has come a long way since the altruistic comedy standings of Key and Peele and last year's muddled, Keanu. But here his dark side shows it's strength, Get Out is the cleverest horror we've had in ages and it's just what we need.

VERDICT: A thrillingly confident debut by Peele a masterfully constructed plot carefully matching horror with hilarious social commentary with natural seat-edge suspense."

494,"8/10 | Is it possible for a movie to be both stupid and smart? both blunt and subtle? Generally speaking, ""no"". But in the case of a film like ""Get Out"", the answer is very much ""yes"". ""Get Out"" is a movie of contradictions. As opposed to being a weakness, the contradictions are completely the point and the movie radiates with them.

This is the directorial debut of Jordan Peele. Better known as the second half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, a duo that has forayed into the movies since the end of their series. Last year it was the comedy ""Keanu"" and now we have Peele by himself behind the camera. For a directorial debut, he shows a real eye for using the camera as an integral aspect of storytelling. Also, he seems to inherently understand what makes good horror work: it's not necessarily what you see that scares you, but what lurks just out of sight.

Further, if this movie was just a skillfully directed horror piece that would be impressive enough, but hung within this horror framework are instances when it also manages to be an entertaining comedy. Without giving anything away, there are two moments of spectacularly jarring musical choices that should jolt the audience out of the movie. Nevertheless, due to the way that the movie is woven together, they become humorous moments without breaking any of the tension.

If all you want is a horror movie that avoids the worst clichés of the genre (e.g. annoying characters doing truly stupid things) then you should enjoy yourself just fine. However, there is so much more to uncover within this movie.

You might be able to guess from the ads that racism plays a pivotal role in this movie. Yet, no one in this movie gives the appearance of being a traditional racist. The movie is much to savvy to depict stereotypical racism. Instead, it delves into far more insidious forms of racism and, by doing so, many of the same story elements could be used to examine any form of prejudice.

On closer inspection, this film exceeds the expectations of a comedic horror movie wherein brain transplant surgery is a real thing. Just as with prejudice, if you take this film at face value, then you've missed the subtle undertones that give life depth. Peele retells a moral told many times before, yet somehow manages to make it feel fresh and interesting.

Peele's directing career is off to a very strong start. I'm exciting to see what he makes next."
495,"10/10 | I really regret the £10 I spent to watch this doubly-racist tripe. It's not a horror movie. But it's not a thriller either. It feels more like a drama film you'd find late-night on channel 5. The film is racist to both black and white people. I can only imagine a black person wrote the movie as there would rightly be an uproar if it was a white person saying to black people ""hey this is how you talk, this is how you dress, your skin colour is important, and no, you're not people who give handshakes, only fist pumps"". I dislike this movie so much that like so many other 1-star reviews here I can't even summon the energy to write about it. After I watched the movie, I saw the trailer for it. THE TRAILER IS THE MOVIE. Every important scene is in the trailer. You're better off just watching the trailer and reading the plot on Wikipedia. Save your energy and don't contribute any money towards a racist project.

497,"10/10 | I usually never write reviews. I sincerely have no patience for it. But this time i had to do it. Possible SPOILERS ahead, but then again, who cares ? It starts from the beginning, it gives away, in my opinion the entire movie. Until the end only in one scene, when our main character leaves his bed for smoking outside we feel a bit of tension, but still, nothing special. There's no tension, no rhythm. A complete borefest and a bad rip off of The Stepford Wives and The Skeleton Key. You know there is a problem with a movie when the comic relief, played by our main character's best friend says the same joke over and over again. Boring, pretentious, unoriginal, predictable and stupid.If you happen to like racist movies,or happen to be in a ""hate the white race mode"", i totally recommend this movie. Watch Sharknado instead. It's bad, but at least it doesn't try to be something it's not.

Are the ""liberal"" social justice narratives and the lobbies really worth that much??

502,"7/10 | Let me get one thing clear, my expectations were high when I sat down to watch this film. Everything I'd heard, everything I'd read suggested I was in for a cinematic masterpiece.

That is not the case whatsoever. The script is contrived (I'm sorry, but the suggestion of racism within the female leads family was introduced with all the subtly of a brick through a window), the main characters unlikable, the set up pace too slow and the very concept of what was going to happen so ridiculous it betrayed any sense of commentary or message the film was trying to convey.

I'll accept this review isn't terribly insightful but in truth I don't want to waste any more time on it than I already have. That said, I feel compelled to warn people off from the OTT hype, with this seemingly just another ""fashionable movie"" (like Drive, which was another one that I found massively disappointing).

I'm afraid the writer/director isn't as clever as he thinks and this film is in no way as good as everyone thinks. I should have realised that from the opening scene where the man on-screen basically talks through what he's doing - something so unrealistic and ridiculous it took my breath away.

I've given this a very generous 2 star rating, although that's mostly because some of the cinematography was fairly decent."
503,"7/10 | I won't even go into minor details how a white person can feel while watching this movie. It's entirely rasistic toward any other color of skin but black. Starting from cliche bad white cop, ""classic"" white family who hate black people - but, wait a minute, want to be like them because black people are superior (it's stated in the movie more than once) etc. The second bad thing is the acting. I could cope with one bad actor, maybe 2 or 3, but the whole crew can't express one single emotion right. The only solid actor was LilRel Howery and maybe, just maybe, Bradley Whitford. LilRel had a classic tvtrope role of a classic ""black guy"" in the movie that shouldn't been racist. I could go on and on about this awful movie, but I will stop right now and just tell people who don't like engaging in current politic situation being on just ONE side, and one side only, to leave this movie to those kind of people

504,"8/10 | I just hate it when every horror/thriller movie takes out intelligence from victims and this movie is very satisfying on this matter. Chris is likable, relatable, intelligent and capable, which automatically makes him stand out as a protagonist in this genre. With underlined political message to think about, the movie takes you on a joyful thriller ride filled with suspense. There's just enough of humor to chuckle through it and it's well timed to not take away from creepiness of the situation. Chris' impressions of things developing are in line with audience which keeps movie on topic every minute of it and doesn't fall behind in keeping it suspenseful.

I've seen lots of people complaining how message about white people playing on privilege is too much in your face and I beg to differ. There's plentiful screenplay lines that affect Chris realistically and that are happening out there in the real world. Anyone who would find character's domination through this story insulting needs to be reminded that that table turns story to story and this story was this guy's turn. While it's good to think about that topic, thrill is guiding the movie and is written for the genre and screened incredibly well - if you'd allow that your ego is so strong to prevent you enjoying such a great cinematic piece, then problem is not the movie, or that message."
505,"8/10 | I have just finished watching this film and I absolutely loved it!, The story moves at a brisk enough pace that I never felt bored, There's enough intrigue to keep you interested and the blend of suspense and then lighter comical moments are done just right, It's very well acted and the lead character(played by Daniel kaluuya) is brilliant, Also I have to say I found his best friend ""Rod""(played by Lil Tel Howery) hilarious he had me in stitches!,So often these films that are hyped up are disappointing but this is the exception,I would definitely recommend it!,I gave this film the full ten out of ten as there is literally nothing bad I can say about it.

506,"7/10 | Get Out is an instant classic, turning an everyday awkward concern into a plot to an intense horror masterpiece that makes you feel for its main character. You'd think while watching whoever made this is a film veteran who can really create atmosphere and mood perfectly, but Jordan Peele is a first time director and you can really tell he put a ton of effort and inspiration from other horror flicks into this one. The climax is satisfying and crazy and it leaves you surprised and afraid when all the puzzle pieces get put together and Chris needs to... well... get out.

Daniel Kaluuya makes for a well-done protagonist, and every antagonist is creepy, twisted and well portrayed in this under-looked gem of excitement.

It is inspiring to young aspiring filmmakers to just do it and be creative.

It's a 10."

508,"10/10 | Omg, no movie on the planet can get so close to this movie, the story, the acting I legit went on Instagram and all the actors social media's and contacted them just because of the goodness of this movie. The rating a are amazing too but there are people who rate it low because of the genre saying this movie is horror and mystery witch isn't 100% true, it's just thriller combined with almost all genres. It's extremely funny, so freaking exciting and it was just an amazing piece of art like that's how I would say it. You know how people walk into an art gallery and say ""wow this is an amazing piece of art"" that's exactly what this movie would be if it was an art piece. Like holy I'll give it 10/10 highest ever just because of how good it is. Watch it I'll recommend it for anyone even if you don't really like psychology mystery comedies trust me you will love it.

I love how the director makes a beautiful girl (played by Rose Armitage) can do such dark and crazy things.. I can feel the suspense and the mystery of this Armitage's family.. what i didn't expect is that the ending is so good that makes me so satisfied at the end of the movie..

511,"7/10 | Get Out is a great horror film for horror movie fans. there are unexpected laughs in the film that go with the subject of racism in America and sex slaving between the main guy Chris and his best friend Rod. all the performances are really good especially for the newcomer Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main guy Chris who goes to his girlfriends family's house estate to see her parents who are greatly performed by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener. this does deliver a couple of jump scares but it focuses on the psychological side of the film which I think it's a good thing that happens in the film.

I think that this film is great for all horror movie fans all out there from all around the world.

Everything about this film was perfect and I remember walking out of the cinema, having to take a breath as I was so shocked at what I had witnessed. I will not emphasize this anymore, if you are a true movie buff. You need to see this film, even if you don't like it. Watch it, because I can tell you now, there will be something that you'll love about this film.

513,"9/10 | It started out a bit slow, but the creepy-ness of the people held my interest. Then the suspenseful part came and it goes uphill from then on. The acting is top notch and the cinematography is good. I'm giving it a seven because of the initial pace and the general plot is kinda ""guessable"" if not predictable.

However, I don't know how you'll see it if you're either black or white. Since I'm neither, I can't judge from that angle.

514,"9/10 | Many people have said that this movie is racist towards white people and so for that reason i went into this experience with a dose of skepticism. After seeing the movie, i will say that while there is racial tension, it was never to the point of labeling any race as racist, but in fact showing the awkward nature of racial tensions and the comedy that can come about from it. Jordan Peele used it in a way that was reminiscent of British humour, which is something i really enjoyed. On top of that, we have some first rate suspense and a strong sense of anticipation. The ending was a bit of a let down, but it didn't derail what was a throwback to classic horror with some humour thrown in there for good measure!

515,"1/10 | I am a huge fan of Jordan Peele. I loved Key and Peele and loved that the duo stepped into making a film with a pretty good comedy in Keanu. All that said I had some strong reservations about Jordan Peele stepping out of his comedic element and into a horror especially one that is psychological. I didn't know what to make of the trailer. I was thinking that this had to be one of those ""horrors with humor"", I just couldn't see Peele stepping that far out of his comfort zone. While I feel this film gets overrated by the masses, its quite a successful venture for Peele.

The film follows a black man named Chris and his white girlfriend Rose. Rose decides to introduce her boyfriend to her family. While everything seems peachy at first it soon becomes obvious to Chris that something is way wrong. The black workers in the house act so weird and reserved and the extended family and friends of Rose are far too intrigued by Chris and the color of his skin. While I won't divulge any deeper into the plot, I'd say this was a fairly satisfying film. Its an interesting effort by Peele, that has some real world relativism.

The scares are predictable and come in moments that are exactly where we expect them to be. The film still keeps you engaged and entertained and coming up with theories of your own as you go along for the right. The film is kind of predictable at least the main arc of what is actually going on with the family. That really doesn't take away from what is given. There is a fair bit of nice imagery, which goes to show some of the creativity Peele had for this. The social and racial aspect of this film can't be denied, its a bit of a social commentary.

This will probably be a breakout role for Kaluuya, he's come a long way from that episode of Black Mirror. The film received higher praise than i think it deserves but it does a good job at being a thrilling and engaging film. I am very optimistic about seeing whatever Jordan Peele decides to do next because I am certain now that he is very capable of going outside the comedy box.

517,"8/10 | Finally. Finally, a good horror movie. It is far between, but Get Out can warmly recommended if you like both good movie, and an eerie and thrilling experience.

I will not divulge any of the action. Read minimum possible about the plot before you see it. But what I can write is that the film has an action that builds long plot up, and giving the audience hints along the way. The film also features traditional elements of horror, which causes one to sprinkle. But some of the best of the film is the combination unconventional action, in combination with good horror effects.

The actors were unknown to me at the forefront, but the convicts to the fullest. Enjoy also the raw end. For this is a film that delivers until it is finished!

This is a warm recommendation!

519,"7/10 | Get Out is an all new horror film directed by (yes, the comedian) Jordan Peele. It was very interesting to see that a comedian had directed this ""horror"" movie and executed it so well. Surprisingly, I wasn't necessarily scared! I was more in shock if anything. This movie seems to poignantly point out horror themed references but it fails to truly make them remarkable. It seems like at first that it doesn't take itself seriously, but some scenes just get more and more peculiar. While it's a weird movie; I can agree it's easily one of the best thrillers you can see this year. It definitely has an idea that strikes out at you in expectations. But I feel it's failed to truly stand as a horror film. Is this a recommended movie? Yes, for what it is. But would I classify this as a horror film? No. I would not. The acting was great and the story was so-so, but in all, it definitely is worth the watch!

520,"7/10 | Jordan Peele's directorial debut is a smash hit. A great take on the horror genre with enough comic satiric material to keep you on the edge of you seat both in terror and abdominal pain. The movie tackles the always complex and divisive theme of race, but it passes the test with flying colors not coming off offensive by any standards. All politics aside the movie is a pure joy to watch. From the simplicity of its shot design to the fool proof way it is directed. The movie is truly remarkable considering that this is Jordan Peele's first movie. Having said this I do think the movie has been garnering exaggerated praise. The movie is a really fun watch but that's about it. For a movie with a 99% (as of today) on RT i found it rather dull and lacking in substance. What it lacks in substance it more than makes up for in style. The movie creates situations that should be frightening but my reaction is laughter. And that's directly the focal point of the man behind the camera and his humor. Regardless the movie builds up to an impressive third act where the funny just leaves and here is where the horror in this movie truly shines. Regardless if I had to compare this movie with A Cure for Wellness (both original horror movies) I would tell you the following. If you love film, composition, and direction see A Cure for Wellness. But If you wanna see a horror film with your friends and just have a good time, well Get Out is your flick."
521,"3/10 | Get Out was a wonderful watch - I found myself alternating between laughing in shock and disbelief, laughing in genuine good-natured joy and (of course, as it is a horror) finding myself deeply afraid for the protagonist's well-being.

I wouldn't say Get Out revolves around a ""twist"" - because a twist implies something unexpected, and while it isn't entirely *expected*, the script did an amazing job of laying all the pieces out for you to realize what was going on on your own time. That said, the ending is intensely satisfying. It has all the hallmarks of a great horror film for me; the protagonist is extremely likable, there's gore and anticipation and characters with disgusting (but realistic) motivations, and the bad ends for each individual who has one feel completely justified and necessary.

Growing up in a very diverse metropolitan area in the US and seeing how different the suburbs can be, I found it a plausible-yet-morally-unthinkable extension of real-life unpleasant racial dynamics. For the skeptics among us, brushing up on your history of medical atrocities will give the film some much-needed context - and despite the very heavy themes throughout, the main character's attitude and simple ability to keep going in a horrible situation (as well as the comedic elements) keep Get Out from being unwatchably dark. Highly recommended!"
522,"3/10 | I try to have an open mind about things, I don't like movies that portray any race as bad people. Yes, throughout history groups of people have committed horrible atrocities against other peoples. But as a rule, unless it's in the context of historical storytelling, I prefer to steer clear. That being said, I heard about the hype that this movies was great and decided to check it out. The only thing this movie made me think about was; If this movie was remade with the races reversed then how would it be received?

523,"1/10 | Hey, this movie have actually done it! And I can't think of anything that did it before this one - it managed to be totally supportive on black/white racial equality by being equally insulting to both white and black people! Really, if someone told me the whole story of this before I watched it I would react exactly like the cops in this movie.

Seriously, this flick looks like it was filmed with just a draft of a script and I wouldn't even call it a horror. It is unoriginal and rather ridiculous than frightening. Don't waste your time - it's the most valuable resource you have!

PS: It honestly sickens me to even think that, but I have a slight notion it has such high ratings because of the racial angle of the production. Which is sad actually, because I don't believe people of minorities make worse anything as a rule, which means their works need not to be given any undeserved praise - that is not what equality means, people, that is actually a bad, harmful idea - if, say, a movie is praised as good - or even best like Moonlight - just because of some misguided parity sense - in other words, just because it was made mostly by minority members, and apart from that it is, like Moonlight or Ida,mediocre at best, then it harms the minority more than it helps it. It's simple - if you do anything and you are objectively not best in it, or you suck at it even, but everyone around you tells you, that what you do is awesome, then you don't have any incentive to try harder and be better.

It can even be a source of deep frustration as you can sometimes tell that you're getting undeserved praise, like from a overbearing parent, and deep down you know it is not sincere and something else entirely stands behind it. Like some politics that don't concern you personally as a creator.

If my work was praised no matter how bad it was just because of my color, beliefs or ethnicity, I know I would not be happy or satisfied with it. Also such practices make room for unethical creators who will see that picking up a specific set of topics for their works will automatically allow them to get ahead of any competition just because the topic is politically desired to be shown in certain context rather than the quality of the work itself. It's damaging and demoralizing."
524,"10/10 | I heard good things about this film, but beyond that I really didn't know much about it - comedy or horror or a mix, that was about it. What I got reminded me of Black Mirror in terms of its tone and dark but yet slightly comic material. The plot starts with an oddly racial situation, where the family are well meaning and accepting, but at the same time not in a way where the black/white divide is not clearly present in some way. From here it starts to add gentle shifts of tension and a creeping sense of unease and dread across the plot. It is this element that works best because it provides engagement, leading to a reasonably short period of reveal and resolution - this final section working best because of the investment in the mystery side.

The film is well paced to do this, and the plot is satisfying in the way that it uses race, but at the same time stands on its own feet without it being a theme if you don't see it or want it. First and foremost it is a horror, and it is an effective one. The cast work really well from top to bottom. Kaluuya leads the film well, and is convincing in all his moments. Williams is good, and holds her own alongside Whitford, Root, and Keener. Howery gets his performance just right - he could easily have been too much comedy, but he hits his marks importantly.

Get Out is a smartly created horror/chiller where race is used as a strong foundation, but not in a way that the film forgets what it is trying to do."
525,"9/10 | ""Get Out"" follows a young black man who heads to his white girlfriend's parents' home in an upscale bedroom community. Things are a bit off from the beginning, but they become progressively weirder—and worse—as his visit unwinds.

Decried by the political right as ""racist"" and touted as a racial-political masterpiece by the left, it seems to me that most people are forgetting that, at the end of the day, ""Get Out"" is a horror film, and it earns its thrills amicably. Of course there are racial politics being commented on here—at times far too heavy-handedly so—but one has to remember that Peele's script is an exaggerated distortion as commentary on the current social climate around race as a topic; it's hyperbole at its finest.

As a horror film, ""Get Out"" is successful because it manages to generate tension and push buttons in all the right places. It plays to audience expectations just about as much as it doesn't, so there is both intrigue and the expected catharsis these films are known for delivered equal measure. Peele wears his influences on his sleeve here, with ""The Stepford Wives"" (novel and film) being a chief template, even down to the film's primly manicured lawns in what is ostensibly anywhere, Connecticut, USA.

The off-kilter atmosphere is strengthened by astute performances from all involved: Daniel Kaluuya is a sympathetic lead, and Allison Williams, though I found her profoundly annoying in the first two acts, plays the finale much better. Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford play the white liberal country clubbers who voted for Obama to a t, but sublimate a perceptible weirdness that adds to the tension (especially Keener). The performances from Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel are also noteworthy in their utter weirdness, marked by odd expressions, movements, and gestures that throw the audience off over and over again. I did find the final act and reveal, as fun as it is, a bit routine; it's remarkably playful and has some clever shifts, but at the same time, it's nothing we haven't seen before—that said, it is nonetheless nicely played.

In the end, ""Get Out"" is a legitimately fun, atmospheric, and suspenseful offering. A large part of what allows the film to surprise its audience is its core commentary and observations on race, and what Peele has in essence done is inject that into a tried-and-true genre setup. It's wryly political as much as it is committed to maintaining its horror prerequisites. 7/10."
526,"7/10 | This is such a clever film. Not only does it have a thrilling, unpredictable and often shocking plot, but it also brilliantly interweaves the horror/mystery element with fantastic comedy and strong social satire. Brilliantly directed by Jordan Peele from start to finish, and featuring an entire cast of excellent performances, Get Out is a hugely entertaining movie that you really won't be able to take your eyes away from.

If there's one thing that really works about this film, however, it's the story. Don't go into this expecting a typical horror movie, because you'll come out disappointed. Whilst Peele brilliantly honours so many classic elements of the genre, this is much closer to a mystery thriller than a bog-standard scarefest, and although there are one or two fun jumpscares, it's the tension of the story that'll really get you hooked.

With an immediately unsettling atmosphere, Get Out is a riveting watch right from the start. However, what it does best is patiently build more and more tension and mystery into the plot as it moves along. The opening act won't have you on the edge of your seat, but it effectively establishes the strangely uneasy atmosphere of the big country house, something that plays a big role in making the following two acts work so well.

From then on, it's twists and turns galore as the film dives into thrilling and even shocking territory. I'll avoid all spoilers as always, because you really don't want to miss the incredible reveals that happen again and again throughout the movie, reveals that turn it from an unsettling thriller/horror parody into something much darker, and yet so ludicrous you could never see it coming.

And that's where the comedy comes in. As strong as the eerie atmosphere is throughout the movie, the story would be lost if there wasn't a good sense of humour thrown in too. As I said, things do take a turn for the more preposterous in the latter stages, but it works perfectly because the film always lets you know it's not taking itself too seriously, right from the start.

But the great thing is that it's not the sort of comedy that would make this a horror-comedy. Whilst it definitely leans more towards enjoyment over scares, the humour in Get Out is fantastically nuanced throughout, never cheapening the nail-biting thrills of its atmosphere and story, yet still making for some brilliant laughs.

You do get a good bit of comic relief from time to time thanks to Daniel Kaluuya's effortless charisma, as well as the hilarious supporting performance from Lil Rel Howery, but the best laughs in the movie come from the mix with the almost comically unsettling world of the upper middle class white people.

And that's where the last spark of genius comes in. Jordan Peele's screenplay is already thrilling and funny, but what makes it even more impressive is its ingenious social satire. Although a little heavy-handed on the subject in the opening act, the film eventually gets into its stride with an utterly hilarious series of jabs at the suspiciously sanitised world of upper middle class white people.

With all of the actors playing along brilliantly, to the extent where you get an insanely creepy Village Of The Damned vibe from the white side of the cast, there's so much fun to be had with the film's satire of that side of society, as well as awkward race relations that are brought up time and time again. It's a brilliantly clever touch, and it adds so much enjoyment to the movie as a whole.

Finally, we need to quickly talk about the performances and the directing. The entire cast is fantastic throughout, all playing their roles appropriately for both a horror movie and something a little more comical, helping to glue Peele's two genres together so effortlessly, with particular stand-out performances from Daniel Kaluuya, Lil Rel Howery, Betty Gabriel and Stephen Root.

And then we come on to Jordan Peele's brilliant directing. I've already talked about how perfectly unsettling and creepy this movie is from start to finish, as well as its brilliant blend of humour, satire and thrills, but I also can't ignore how well-paced and well- established this film is. With some excellent editing as well, Peele's fun- loving yet unnerving style works an absolute treat throughout, and that's the final reason that this film just comes together so well.

Overall, I absolutely loved Get Out. It's a seriously creepy and unsettling film right the way through, and one that will have you biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat right up to the end. However, it's also much more than a brilliant thriller, with amazing humour and social satire thrown into the story, a whole host of amazing performances, and stunning direction from Jordan Peele."
527,"3/10 | ""Get Out"" is a horror-thriller directed by the hilarious Jordan Peele. The movie is centered around Chris, a young African American man, and his Caucasian girlfriend, Rose. The couple have been dating for five months, and the time to meet the parents has arrived. In a very well-directed scene between Chris and Rose, we learn that Chris is reluctant to meet her parents - because as far as he knows, they are unaware of his skin color. When the couple arrive at the parent's house, Chris is greeted warmly - TOO warmly. It's even eerie. Over the course of his visit, Chris becomes increasingly uncomfortable in this place. I won't spoil anything, but this movie becomes more and more unsettling with each scene.

Surprisingly, this movie functions as a comedic satire, a social drama, and a horror movie. Jordan Peele has found a way to send a message about modern racial prejudices, while incorporating hilarious comedic relief throughout. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's a good thing. However, it sure does scare. It scares you in a way that you weren't expecting. It toys with your emotions. You feel anxious for Chris' safety, you feel terrified of racism, and you feel amused with how over-the-top the entire movie is.

""Get Out"" takes plenty of risks. It paints an incredibly unique picture of racism in America. And that's probably the most horrifying thing of all."
528,"5/10 | Jordan Peele's Get Out is a new take on a classic story. Get Out takes this approach to examine the state of racism in our so called ""post-racism"" society. From the very start of the film, a sense of uneasiness is present in the main character, Chris. This uneasiness is maintained and heightened as events unfold. Viewers are set into a cycle of uncertainty, fear, and momentary relief; they are pressed with visceral feelings that accumulate as the story unfolds. You really don't know what is going on until the final act of the film where the curtains fly open. The mis-en-scene of every scene is dramatically important; we are given clues of the future from the very start of the film. There are times where a seemingly meaningless joke has tremendous implications. The deep web of foreshadowing can only be appreciated after subsequent viewings.

Of course a riveting story is important, but so is the cinematography and sound. Peele's use of zooms, extreme close ups, high angles, low angles, create a collage of scenes that are laid out beautifully on-screen. These techniques enhance the viewer experience and improves storytelling. Sounds are equally important. The phenomenal score bounced between moments of silence and intense, heart wrenching music. The dialogue and acting are both very fluid and the script never stops impressing. Most importantly however, is the use of dietetic sound for storytelling. The main characters experience important moments of sound that impact their state of mind in the scene.

Overall the film leaves almost nothing to be desired; it is a journey that ends on a very satisfying note."

531,"2/10 | The first 45 minutes to an hour had me sitting on the tip of my seat. The movie gives you this very uncomfortable feeling; you know something really bad is about to happen, but you don't know what... it keeps you on edge and that's great. After the plot twist, however, my interest dwindled slightly.

I really liked the main character - great performance by Daniel Kaluuya, by the way - and it's easy to sympathise with him. Maybe that's also because he seems to be one of the very few sane people in the movie. You'll find yourself rooting for him. The other members of the cast also play their roles very well. There isn't a bad actor or actress in this film. The humour is quite well done. The jokes are funny but also feel kind of awkward, which is exactly what suits this movie. The story is good, definitely, and absolutely original, but I'm not sure how to feel about the plot twist. It almost feels silly, but I guess that's kind of the point.

In summary, this movie is intriguing and original and worth the watch."
532,"1/10 | I have never seen a better movie that depicts the insidious, rather than overt, nature of racism. This movie is for all the white folks who think ""they aren't racist."" There are so many layers to this movie: majority culture coercing the minds of the minority, the annoyance of having to explain your identity to every white person around you, the societal eye-rolls when a black person goes missing, the ""violent nature"" of a black man (gaslighting at its finest).. Sometimes, the everyday occurrences that a person experiences is more painful than one traumatic event. This movie perfectly depicts just that.

And to all those that complain that this movie ""played the race card:"" this is like complaining that the Pirates of the Caribbean movie played the ""pirate card."" Why isn't racism a legitimate theme in cinema? Oscars, I'm looking at you. I understand why some white folks don't like having a mirror held in front of them, but that doesn't make those suffering from ""well-intentioned"" white people disappear. Looking away is culpability and watching this movie is one small step in the opposite direction. And isn't that the whole point of art? To open your eyes, to make you feel? Doesn't the best kind of art make you feel uncomfortable, and in that discomfort, change your perspective? This is a horror movie told through the eyes of a black man, but unlike slasher films, this horror comes from a very real place. This is what I learned from watching this movie as a white woman, so excuse my ignorance, as I am not black. I can never begin to understand how that feels. Ignorance is bliss, which is a dangerous luxury that is not afforded to all."
533,"8/10 | You know we are in a post-Oscars movie slump when a satire horror like Get Out (2017) can generate global praise for bravely cutting new ground in film. The truth is: it does not. What it does is satirise the political correctness of a white majority that expresses racial tolerance but harbours malice for those who are different. Set aside that message and you are left with a well-paced, well- acted but predictable horror film that preys on white guilt and coloured fear.

The storyline is clear-cut and entirely consistent with the standard tropes of zombie-like horrors. Cool black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his gorgeous wide-smiling girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been dating seriously for a few months when Rose arranges a weekend to meet the parents. She insists that it is not worth mentioning that Chris is a black dude as her neurosurgeon father Dean and psychiatric hypnotherapist mother Missy are so liberally non-racist that ""they would have voted for a third Obama term"". Driving onto the sprawling grounds of her parent's home Chris notices a black gardener with a weird smile who stares vacantly. The camera cuts to Chris's face and we know immediately what he is thinking. After an effusively over-friendly greeting by the parents at the front doorstep, Chris sees a black housemaid with the same weirdly vacant stare. After an awkwardly polite dinner where Chris is subjected to the usual new-boyfriend interrogation, Missy tricks him into being placed in a hypnotic state that renders him controllable by the tinkling of a spoon in a teacup. From here on, the story shows Chris increasingly entrapped by the family until he realises his life is in danger and that he must 'get out'.

From the minute that Chris sees the look on the gardener's face most of the script is laid bare. If that does not sufficiently telegraph the narrative arc that lies ahead, the dinner with the parents make the trap and its dangers obvious. The story pivots on the plausibility of a tinkling teacup making Chris comatose and the duplicity of his girlfriend as the collector of fine black human specimens for neuro-transplant purposes. But of course, in the horror genre there are no boundaries for plausibility and no limits to the gory ways of ending someone's life. While the plot's weirdness requires suspension of disbelief, the casting and acting is excellent and delivers entertainment value for horror audience's money. Although words like original do not suit this film, it is tightly directed and holds enough twisted surprises to keep viewers engaged as it cruises to its entertainingly blood-filled climax.

Some of the over-hyped publicity surrounding this film dwells more on its racial message than its merits as a horror film. Indeed, some are even calling it a landmark in socially progressive film. For this to pass any plausibility test, we must be prepared to imagine that the most vocal middle-class supporters of racial equality in contemporary society are most likely the ones that, subliminally at least, harbour the most evil intentions towards coloured minorities. This would be a regressive exploitation of a complex social issue that, in this writer's view, is not what this film is about. It's just an entertaining horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire that is filling cinemas while we wait for the next round of Oscar nominated movies."
534,"7/10 | Despite the low ratings by white supremacists who obviously hate black people and cannot handle the black perspective,this movie is good.The acting is great,the plot is engaging and I watched beginning to end edge of my seat. I'm glad it got a high overall score. Some people can never get past a movie that sheds any white person in a bad light and a black person is the main character.If you can get past that-are emotionally mature and intelligent enough to enjoy a movie for what it is- entertainment-i recommend Get Out.It is original and will stay with you for a long time.

535,"5/10 | Sadly, it is the most racist movie that I, and probably anyone here, have ever seen. The whole movie is based on the concept of race differences. Only black people are presented as good and physically superior human beings while all the whites are jealous emotionless rich psychos who crave for blacks strength and superiority. Actually I could say much more about symbolism in this movie and disgusting insinuations but what I've just written is enough. Really? It is even hard to believe that such movie was released. I guess it had never been if the roles in the movie were reversed.

536,"1/10 | White girl has a black boyfriend and they decide to spend a weekend away with her parents for the first time. He is told that her parents are unaware she is dating a black guy and he feels uncomfortable about the pending visit.

For me, the portrayal of the girlfriend was a bit full on, she was annoying and uncomfortable in the role, maybe this was purposeful, a hint at what was to come, but I feel she was just not right for the part. Then i read her bio and find she's the daughter of prominent news anchor, and things seem to make sense.

I got all the racist jokes, the irony of the ending scenes etc but there have been better movies that have dealt with race issues in the same way, and there were no surprises in the movie itself, you know whats going to happen, it's all a bit weak, completely unrealistic, and no real horror to be had. There are periods of suspense and a bit of blood on occasion, and I did like the hypnotism inclusion and the way it was woven into the plot. The main guy must have been cast due to his eyes alone, he looks like he being tortured while just reading a book. The guy playing the father was OK, again, laid it on thick, it was part of the plot to do so, but it still made the movie almost a parody of itself, they were out to get him from the start of the movie, as the trailer suggests, and it was portrayed just like this, almost slapstick in its application. This kinda ruined the 'horror' mood for me. Still had its moments, there were macabre aspects to this portrayal and elements of a generic type slasher film. But I was left disappointed, I kinda got exactly what I expected, thought the ending was a bit of comic relief actually. Next"
537,"7/10 | Honestly, I enjoyed this movie in many ways. But guess what? I'm a priviledged, straight and white male. According to the movie I'm evil, so is my whole family and every white friend I have. So I'm going to rate this 1/10. This day doesn't need one single tiny bit of support for material like this.

539,"6/10 | This movie has the similar atmosphere of Wicker Man or Rosemary's Baby but in a modern version, it is like a fresh movie using those concepts, the movie is great and is well written, with good acting, I do not know how to explain that the movie can be sometimes slow but in a good way, the movie keeps you interested even if you already figured out what is happening, there are only good points in this movie, I cannot think of a bad point because even the humor is well applied, the concept is great...

I recommend to see this movie without any doubt, but if you don't like psychological suspense / horror or similar, stay away from this gem.

I liked the subtle hints like the black mold in the basement and the all black cars bringing the family to the reunion. I thought Daniel Kaluuya did a great job with his role and nothing felt fake about the movie.

541,"8/10 | Being a fan of Jordan Peele from Key & Peele, I came to the movie knowing his comedic and satirical chops, and his directorial debut definitely doesn't disappoint. I am rarely a fan of horror, but when horror is used how it should be - to magnify real societal wounds and inequalities — then I become the biggest fan. Hollywood horror films nowadays are jump scares, cash cows and unnecessary violence and gore without realistic characters. Get Out stands out among a handful others recently to really use the genre well.

543,"8/10 | I rarely watch films that are hyped up by film critics as I know that such 'critics' are always more impressed by the expression of their own knowledge, understanding and overall genius than by anything else. They try to impress the uneducated masses, that is the rest of us, with their brilliant analyses, particularly of modern films which address what they see as serious social issues.

I decided to watch ""Get Out"" partly because the premise looked reasonably interesting and partly because it had received some good reviews. What a mistake; I really should have stuck with my usual approach.

For the most part, it's boring and predictable and, as has been mentioned by other reviewers here, if the colours of the main characters were reversed, the film would have been greeted with outrage rather than plaudits. The occasional interlude of foul language from a peripheral character and some scenes of gruesome violence in the last 15 minutes are largely irrelevant and unnecessary. To a considerable extent, the film makes little sense; it's nothing more than an attempt to demonstrate how badly those nasty white folk treat the black folk and how the black folk will win out in the end.

There is little acting other than the now usual 'meaningful looks', and the limited script is pretty banal. Overall, whatever the clever critics might say, it's dull and has nothing new to say about anything; there is no originality of any sort. That said, it's not terrible, it's just very, very average bordering on poor and, as such, it gets 3 / 10 from me."
544,"9/10 | Take out the Race element, and this would be very much the sort of routine shocker you see on the Horror channel (except more predictable than most). Yet it was no doubt the Race angle that allowed the producer to get the budget to give it a Hollywood gloss, and it's also the Race angle that means it doesn't quite make sense: if the bad guys are racists, why do they want to be black people? I had a nagging feeling - and nagging is the word - that some kind of deep allegorical meaning was intended; and I think the main reason people watch this sort of thing is that they enjoy a little thrill of liberal guilt.

548,"9/10 | I will briefly describe the basic values that elevate a movie from just being bytes on a medium, to an over the screen experience. The reason I am doing so, is to contradict exactly what ""Get Out"" undoubtedly is not. And what ""Get Out"" undoubtedly is NOT, is a good movie in any sense whatsoever. I will be brief and avoid any kind of spoilers, as my intention is not to prevent people from watching the movie, it is to keep the light of hope lit.. That people will start watching -not looking.. thinking and processing -not accepting, forming opinions -not adopting the ones for sale.. -Predictability- A good movie should not be predictable. It should drag you into the created background and guide you through the story without knowing what the upcoming events would be. By watching ""Get Out"" for just 10 minutes, I knew... Exactly what would follow.. Every scene was a spoiler to the next one, every dialogue was an insult to any point of Intelligence quotient that the viewer -a Human Being (the supposedly most intelligent creature on the third planet that orbits around the Sun) - may have. -Cliché- A definition of 'Cliche', would be the overuse of an element,expression or idea, to the point of losing its original meaning or effect, even to the point of becoming trite or irritating.. The words written above, just described the whole movie. All cliches where gathered, polished and submitted, in a way that their sole successful contribution, is making the movie even more predictable, and ultimately insulting, to any political animal with the power of moral reasoning. -Meaning- Where some movies excelled and ensured their passage from past participle to present continuous, is their underlying meaning, or message left for the viewers to pick up, process and interpret. If I do pick up, process and interpret the 'meaning' of ""Get Out"", what I am left with is the notion that Caucasian humans have nocturnal souls. And all those Caucasian nocturnal souls, are boiling in vengeful lust that transforms into relentless viciousness explicitly appointed towards people with darker color of skin. If racism would be fitted in a sentence, it would be awfully similar to the one above.The belief that all members of each race possess characteristics, abilities, or qualities specific to their race. This movie is racism. It is against equality, it is against atonement, evolution and progress.

I could keep expressing my personal opinion why ""Get Out"" is an insult to intelligence, yet I will not. I would not write this review under normal circumstances and keep people to oblivion, but I just found out that this 'movie' is nominated for a plethora of Oscar's, and it hurt every single brain cell residing in my cranial cavity. Please, watch this movie.. But really watch.. Think, process.. And keep in mind.. That we sometimes have to live up to the fact we are the creature with the most processing power contained in a magnificent instrument called the brain."
549,"9/10 | I am definitely not one for horror films, and if you take a look at my other reviews, there is only one other review that would fit the horror genre - The Exorcist. And I only have that because I was forced to watch it for a film studies class, which in hindsight, I may have been able to request to not watch it.

Anyway, the reason I am saying this, is because I looked online beforehand to research extensively, how much horror this movie contained. I read a review that said it was more thriller than horror, and the person wrote in detail the parts which would frighten. It wasn't much of a spoiler for me, because I usually don't remember the things I've read or seen when watching a movie. Anyway, I decided to trust this person, because they sounded quite honest. And it was worth it. For anyone out there who cannot stand horror movies, I am with you, and this film is OK to watch. There are a few scenes that initiate jolts - and this is mainly accompanied with loud sound effects. But for the most part, these scenes are quite troll like, in the sense that Peele wanted visceral reactions (as heard in an interview with Jimmy Kimmel), and inserted these loud, abrupt sound effects in order to achieve that.

What I can't stand about horror movies, is mainly the horrific make- up/ costumes, and of course, the eerie soundtrack which no horror movie is complete without. But for this movie, it focuses more on the story, rather than the actual scaring part, and so I would say they wrongly categorized it, as it is more thriller than horror.

Moving on, Kaluuya puts on an amazing performance. I previous saw him in an episode of Black Mirror, and have to say that he is really talented. His expressions in Get Out, and especially the iconic 'sink' scene (which can be seen in the trailer), is phenomenal. Williams too, does a great job, and their chemistry on screen is well established. I would have to say that Gabriel was another actress of which the film would be incomplete without. Her emotionless stares are super bizarre, but is what makes her character. Howery, plays the comic relief for this film, and his personality really shines through. His character helps the movie stay above the line into total darkness.

However, the ending pushed it over the edge into ridiculousness. It was bordering between being realistic but freaky, and sci-fi comedy throughout the film, but the ending just pushed it all the way into the sci-fi comedy realm. I'm not saying that the genre is bad, but it was so good at giving that thrilling atmosphere, until it just gave it away.

So, in general, I'd say that this is a great thriller, with amazing acting, directing, and cinematography, but a poor ending."
550,"1/10 | This is the story of an African American who is headed to meet his girlfriend's parents. Once he gets there things start to go a little awkward.

This movie is slow. But it keeps you active. It has the power of expectation which is going to make you have questions and want answers. followed by great acting and music, the movie will lead you to the end and probably flip you out.

The horror is pretty well. Left behind the horror full of screamers, this horror, in my opinion, is more psychological. You will get along with the main character and feel or at least think how would it be to be living that situation.

The movie also has some humor that is going yo be expressed by some stereotypes specially.

But the movie has a problem, It is predictable. Much of the situations during the movie (most of all in the end) are actually scenes which outcomes we are ready to see.

See this movie but be patient. Don't worry if it is slow. In the end you will realize whether it was or not a good movie."
551,"1/10 | When a movie that has 100% rotten tomatoes score and almost an 8 on IMDb, your hopes are high as a kite. Unfortunately it was a VERY mediocre movie. The blatant use of racism was cringe worthy and i am sure there would've been a lot of hue and cry if the roles were reversed.

After watching the movie, i can confidently attribute the score and good reviews to white guilt and the liberal leaning of the reviewers. Of course nobody wants to trash this movie and come across as a racist

So tired of pumped up, PC reviews on IMDb and elsewhere.

552,"1/10 | Racist people want the skin of the people they feel superior to!? Alone this big flaw makes this movie total nonsense as a political comment. On top this movie is marketed as a piece of horror, well there is around 3 % horror in it, maybe 4%, but that's it. On top, the implemented ""black buddy stuff"" feels out of place and takes any seriousness out of this movie. I don't know how this movie can get so much praise, as a horror movie it is without horror, as a comedy the elements of humor are a mixed experience, as a thriller the comedy elements destroy every notion of a ""thrilling atmosphere"", and like I already said, as a political satire etc. the premise, agenda is all wrong.

So what's left!? Get Out is no disaster and some scenes are entertaining but all in all Get out is a mediocre flick, the cook didn't know if he wanted to cook a piece of haute cuisine or just a burger with some french fries.

Because of all those big praises, I was expecting a masterpiece, my disappointment results in a straight 1, without that great expectations I would rate 5."
553,"10/10 | Review: This is one messed up film! Now that I have finally watched it, I can understand why some people found it quite disturbing but the ending brought some justice to the whole messed up situation. Daniel Kaluuya plays a black photographer, Chris Washington, who is in a happy relationship with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams). They decide to go to Roses parents house, and he soon realises that they have a weird outlook towards black people. With a black woman and man as there servants, and various statements about his colour, he bites his tongue and he attends there annual party, which also leads to more racial comments. When Chris finally decides to leave, he is faced with an unbelievable situation which leads him to fight for his life. I was definitely shocked with the outcome of this movie, and I wasn't expecting the various twists and turns throughout. It's not everyday that you see a film were the black underdog, triumphs with all the odds stacked up against him, so I have to give the director the thumbs up. The ending seemed a bit abrupt, and it does take some time to get going but once it does, you can't fault it for originality. Personality, I would have got out of the house after the first day, especially after seeing how weird the servants were but I can understand that he was in love with his girlfriend, which is why he was willing to put up with ignorant behaviour from the messed up family and friends. Anyway, I enjoyed the movie and it's definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!

Round-Up: This is the first movie directed by Jordan Peele, 38, who is known for his comedic series Key & Peele, alongside Keegan-Michael Key. The shock success of this movie, brought him to the main stream, and with Keanu also doing well at the box office, the only way is up for the dynamic duo. Although Daniel Kaluuya isn't a household name, he has starred in Cass, Welcome to the Punch, Kick Ass 2, Sicario and the series Skins, so he has had some experience in front of the camera. He definitely brought some intensity to the project, and it was good to see him use his brain towards the end.

Budget: $4.5million Worldwide Gross: $252.5million

I recommend this movie to people who are into their horror/mysteries, starring Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford, Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson and Lakeith Stanfield. 7/10"
554,1/10 | 
555,"7/10 | Get Out is an intense, unnerving movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat --- only if you are satisfied with an adrenal rush and not looking for any depth in the characters or the story. It's a great production done with superb acting, music and visual arrangement, but as a movie about racism it just doesn't go beyond.

It starts with the romance between Rosie and Chris, the sweet white girlfriend and the talented African-American photographer, where Rosie asks Chris to spend a weekend at her posh parents' country house. It's just a weekend, but as things get awry, it escalates to be a matter of life or death. The backdrop can be easily taken as a trope for racial relations/tension in America, but contrary to what Peele the director aspired to do, this movie just couldn't provoke any discussion or shed light on the touchy issues. To have the guests ""locked up"" in a grandiose house with two distinct camps of the white and the black is also a scene that occurs in Tarantino's Django Unchained. While Django Unchained uses a fictional story to unveil the cruelty and injustice of black slavery, Get Out feels more like a sorcerer's tale that manages to carry the label of racism because the victim happens to be a black. The characters are diabolical and psychotic, but they are also flat and uninspiring. They might carry a secret agenda, but it just makes them look like an underground cult group who somehow has a bit of a supernatural power – it must be because some of the things they do are scientifically impossible, e.g. the surgery scene. Their persona and the things that they can physically do – hypnosis by the mother and surgeries by the father – are just not representative at all. They do not carry any association to racists or the xenophobic. In fact, they are also kind of dumb to have that kind of video conferencing set-up in the room where the victim gets to talk to the perpetrator. It works well if the movie wants to create suspense or terror by paying tribute to the horror classic Saw, but again, it doesn't add any depth to an intellectual reflection on racism.

Some people comment that the film commits dogmatic stereotypes. I think the only stereotype used here is that the black and the white are by default at war with each other. Yet, it's used more as a convenient trick to shove the audience into this them-versus-us mentality so we get as suspicious as Chris. The horror is real, the acting is fantastic and does send the chill off your spine, but it doesn't stimulate your thinking or perpetuate any racial prejudices. If this movie is played in a virtual reality movie house, it's top notch; but if it attempts to be meaningful, it is not."
556,"9/10 | This movie was very good. At times it's genuinely creepy at others its downright hilarious, everything a good horror comedy should be. I liked the music also, I thought it was very reminiscent of classic horror films. I don't know if I would count this against the film but the trailer pretty much spoiled everything which was unfortunate. Go check it out if you haven't already.

557,"1/10 | Although I could predict some of the movie's ""mysteries"", I can say it was amazing because it wasn't a cliché movie. Far from the monster/assassin regular stories, it keeps your attention and curiosity from the start and at the end gives you a ""gran finale"". I loved it, hopefully it is going to give some inspiration for innovations in this genre of movie that has been stagnated for quite a time now.

558,"1/10 | It was without no knowledge about what this movie was about when I sat down to watch ""Get Out"". The only thing that I did know about it was the fact that it was a horror movie, and I do enjoy horror movies quite a lot.

I will say that the movie does start out quite alright, albeit it doesn't really have that horror genre feel to it. But the story soon takes a turn into a more bizarre twist. And I mean that in a good way, because the way the story was constructed and set up was actually quite intricate and interesting. Director and writer Jordan Peele managed to introduce an element of confusion to the movie, which keeps the audience in the dark and have the audience guessing at just what exactly is going on. And that was a great accomplishment and definitely something that added a dynamic layer to the movie.

And while the story did seem quite odd and bizarre, it was actually a really good story, and it turned out to be quite interesting and actually well-thought through.

Director Jordan Peele was able to skillfully introduce some great build ups of drama, tension and suspense throughout the course of the movie. And the climaxes of these build ups were equally well brought to realization as well. Again, this really added a lot of depth and worth to the movie.

Furthermore, the movie was really helped a great long way by having some really good acting performances by the cast. I must admit that I was especially impressed with Daniel Kaluuya's performance and how at ease he seemed to be in this role. And I was also quite impressed with Betty Gabriel, although I think it was a shame that her role wasn't bigger and that she only had limited screen time.

The odd dialogue by various characters thought-out the entire movie actually makes sense when the revealing of what actually was happening took place. I will be the first to admit that I was quite puzzled and was wondering about much of the dialogue throughout the movie. But when the plot was revealed, and you look back at the dialogue it all just makes perfect sense.

""Get Out"" is labeled as a horror mystery, but I would say that the mystery aspect of the movie far outweighs the horror aspect. But then again, I would say it is more of a thriller than it is a horror movie. Regardless, then ""Get Out"" is quite an entertaining and interesting movie.

For a directorial debut for Jordan Peele then ""Get Out"" is quite an accomplishment. I was more than genuinely entertained by this movie, and can warmly recommend that you take the time to sit down and watch ""Get Out""."

560,"1/10 | This movie starts slow but leaves you on the edge of your seat with sheer terror and an absolute must see for all of you horror/scary movie buffs. At times in the movie I was gripping my husband's arm so tightly! I was that scared during the movie. In the beginning you tend to like the characters, but they are not all that they seem to be. Surprising twists. Makes you wonder......

561,"10/10 | Set in a ""post racial"" America, 'Get Out' challenges the complacency of a liberal society, setting the audience with deep unease throughout the film, not just by its chilling horror aspects, but rather the disconcerting social attitudes audaciously identified in the white middle class family. Before the main story, which follows Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his weekend away with his girlfriend Rose's (Allison Williams) family, the film opens with an unsettling pre-credits scene of a young black man being jumped to Flanagan and Allen's Run, Rabbit, Run. This establishes the sincerely disturbing tone of the narrative, constantly manipulating the emotions of the viewers in favour of the victims, whilst still expertly retaining elements of subtlety that slowly uncover throughout the film.

'Get Out' incorporates a remarkable array of horror aspects in its 1hr 44min run time – from guts and violence to, most prominently, psych and emotional terror. Each feature is integrated stylistically, culminating to form a smart and consistently tense narrative, although at points flowing just like any other horror movie in terms of set-up, revelation and the sporadic comic relief. Similarly, a significant suspension of disbelief is required to grasp the tenacious premise of the eventual plot drive, which is unveiled in the latter third of the film. Thus, its overarching spread is sometimes too thin and consequently struggles to candidly assemble at the end.

That said however, there is a great deal more to praise about the way in which director Jordan Peele unravels the story towards this climax. The brilliant intricacy of the family's 'acceptance' of Chris' culture, by being overly pleasant that is, superbly exacerbates the tension in the relationship, not just on screen, but between the audience and the characters. The gradual, relentless extrication of the plot is entrancing during the entire course of the film, leaving many aspects rightfully open to the individual interpretation of the viewer, intuitively hinting at Peele's intentions, to isolate the despicable root nature of racism in our society. And my god, does he do an exceptional job.

The casting of Daniel Kaluuya as the lead character, despite the controversy regarding his nationality (ironically), was an excellent decision by Peele; Kaluuya's steady intensity makes it easy to see why the director eventually chose him for the role, having never intended to cast a black British actor initially. The 'Skins' and 'Sicario' co-star is a captivating lead, with the high forecasts for 'Get Out' hopefully projecting this young talent to step into larger roles that he unequivocally deserves. Lil Rel Howery (as the charming Rod Williams) is without doubt the standout supporting member; the comedic timing of his character and the relatable quality of his personality is exceptionally charismatic, adding a meaningful layer of hilarity to the already fascinating spectacle and appealing to wider audiences who would not instinctively connect with the archetypal horror genre.

A movie that exhibits several fresh prospects in the film industry, 'Get Out' is a terrifically innovative film and potentially a generation defining horror."

563,"7/10 | OK, so its only March, but this movie sets the bar pretty high. Its a mainly one of those suspense/atmosphere thrillers. Very few jump scares or gore, thought there are a few scenes that will make most people squirm. Right from the opening credits the music sets this eerie uncomfortable tone and the movie just never lets up.

Go see this movie. Its fun and intelligent. I've watched hundreds of horror movies and have never seen anything quite like it.

Don't listen to those who yell racism. This movie is fun and entertaining. If you see racism everywhere and are looking to label things then yea.. .you will find things to call racist here. You would be better served to see it for what it is.. a good and fun horror movie.

564,"1/10 | Finally, after hearing all the talk and reading tons of reviews, my wife and I set out to see Get Out. Neither one of us despite being very big movie fans consider ourselves to be lovers of horror films but I must say that we were both pleasantly surprised by Jordan Peele's first movie out of the gate. The story itself was solid and suspenseful the acting was second to none and despite being just a tad long in laying the initial groundwork when the characters initially arrive at the parent's home the story pulled together in a very timely fashion. The supporting cast was great and the interjection of comic relief was timely and funny. The horror moments were just that horrific.The story line kept me guessing just long enough to figure what nefarious deeds were happening behind the scenes. The social message and the intertwining within the story itself were illuminative and gave way to a deeper meaning. Hands down Get Out did not disappoint and delivered in a way I have not seen when it comes to horror films and that's saying a lot from someone who doesn't consider himself a horror fan. The film is a must see if you love movies period and I'll be adding Get Out to my collection of Blu- rays. Nine stars indeed and my wife and I look forward to seeing what Mr. Peele has in the pipeline for our future entertainment."
565,"4/10 | i hate the dumb people that think that this is a movie against white people. Jordan Pelee knows that not all white people are racist, he made a horror movie that he knows doesn't happen. Watch the movie it is worth it, you will laugh and you will get scared, cool movie. It is hilarious. It is scary. It is tense.

566,"6/10 | First and foremost, kudos to Jordan Peele. Never in all my years would I have expected horror/drama so well written from a comedian. While the story does have its comedic aspects, it is well balanced with thrills, spooks, and mature storytelling with a very interesting and twisted plot.

As you may be well aware, when it comes to the horror genre, minorities are grossly misrepresented. Get Out, I believe, has been the first horror movie to achieve this level of critical acclamation with a black starring role. Now, I'm not basing the quality of the movie on the fact that the protagonist is a minority, but am only calling to attention the rarity of this type of direction. I feel like this movie opens a door of a genre in which minorities are atypical.

The concept/plot of the movie is different -- the good kind of different. You are lead to believe one thing and the movie elegantly slaps you in the face with a twist. This family is spooky as hell, and they are in a league of their own. While the movie does have a racial focal point, it's no disadvantage to the movie's storytelling, rather adds a level of spookiness to the reality that, no matter what your race, you can find yourself confronting the same horrors as anyone else. This movie does seem to portray a certain allusion to slave trades and whatnot, will admit, but that's not inherently a bad thing, unless you're one of those people that think blacks being victimized by whites can only be political correctness. I actually recall many lambasting this movie as one that makes whites seem like egregious, conniving devils, but when watching the movie it seemed to me, a white guy, a representation of particular crazy individuals, and not at all representative or demeaning of the entire white race like some have commentated.

Aside from the concept, the characters in the movie are so naturally acted and convey their roles with excellent direction.

This movie is no Keanu. Prepare yourself for an actual horror film, not a Scary Movie 3. This movie implements horror and comedy so well that one facet does not impend on the other and everything flows like a well though put story should.

This movie was a great watch. It delivers a level of creepiness, complemented with a unique and creative concept and elements of ""black"" humor."
567,5/10 | 
568,"1/10 | Terrific and inventive screenplay, well acted with brilliant background music that really sets up the scary scenes well. The interracial themes and sub-texts are interwoven throughout the story in very interesting and thought provoking ways. Moderate body count and not for the squeamish but I think there will be a lot of buzz about this one. Oh, and the sidekick is really funny.

Their aim is to further divide us so that we can bring ourselves down without them firing a single shot. When you look at the production companies, you'll find that ""Perfect World Pictures"" (A Beijing-based film-production company) was largely involved. Research, share, and beware!

I don't know what movie is more pathetic, this one which is aimed solely at brainwashed, politically correct liberals, or Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"". At least Tommy, I believe, tried to make a movie to entertain the audience. Failed miserably I might add. This is just a stupid attempt to perpetuate that stereotype that whites are evil, racist monsters. This b.s only appeals to the most unintelligent liberals. Anyone with half a brain can see past this social propaganda piece.

571,"1/10 | the physical chains are easy to break, but the mental chains lasts for generations. i mean i understand slavery and racism was and is still bad, but we are in the age of computers and obama. either the director still has a slave mentality or he is a ruthless promoter/businessman who would cater to the black people's latent slave angst from generations afar. the cinematics and the settings/wardrobe of the film very nicely done, other than that, the movie was crap. i keep thinking about what a genius i am, and if i only make a film, i would blow the entire world away with my sublime entity of being. I don't know if that day shall ever come, but if destiny wills it, it will be done. I mean i can randomly make up films in my mind and the plot is at least 3 times more interesting than this film and the acting is 4 times better and the setting and mood is 7 times better. the cinematics would be about 2 times better. most directors make it in this business not because they can direct, but because they have good interpersonal skills and can promote etc...technology will probably advance to the point where anyone can make a feature film easily and have people watching it, when that time comes, the cream will really rise to the top. right now this director is surfing a wave of black movie popularism. and he was successful in surfing this wave from a financial point of view i guess. sigh, if i can only show my genius film directing mind to the world, then they will be amazed and i shall be a considered a god of thrillers. humans and human psychology, lol, in 300 years through genetic mixing, scientists say we would all be brown, problem solved lol."
572,"1/10 | One of the best of the horror/comedy genre. I had pretty high expectations for this movie because of the awesome marketing campaign and intriguing plot.

If only I could sue the movie studio to be compensated for the two hours of my life wasted viewing this garbage along with feeling like millions of brain cells were killed in the process. Honestly, for people to give this movie anything more than 3 or 4 stars just proves that our society truly is getting fatter, lazier and dumber by the day. Shame on a many of you.

574,"1/10 | The black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) travels with his Caucasian girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to meet her family in their house in the countryside. Chris is worried since Rose 's parents do not know that he is black but he is welcomed by her father, the neurosurgeon Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford); her mother, the psychiatrist Missy (Catherine Keener) that uses hypnotism in her treatments; and her brother Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones). He has also a weird and cold reception from the black servants Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Georgina (Betty Gabriel). During the night, Chris feels uncomfortable and leaves the bed to breath outside the house. When he returns, Missy is in her office and invites him to talk to her about his mother. However she hypnotizes Chris that freezes while his mind travels to a pitch black place called the sunken place by Missy. On the next morning, Chris wakes up in his bed and he believes he had a nightmare. Then he learns that there will be a family party with white guests only. Chris calls his best friend, the airport security guard Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), and he reports the weird events that happened to him. When the guests arrive, Chris feels awkward and convinces Rose to leave the house at night. While packing his clothes to travel back home, Chris finds photographs and the dark secret of the Armitage family.

""Get Out"" is an above average horror film by Jordan Peele with a flawed story about veiled racism and without any message and excessive hype. The first half is great and Walter, Georgina and Andre Hayworth look like characters from the 1975 ""The Stepford Wives"". The second half becomes a joke and the happy ending does not fit well to the story with so many holes and evidences against Chris. Allison Williams is amazing, changing her behavior from a lovely girlfriend to a cruel woman. Catherine Keener is also excellent in the role of a cold hypnotherapist. Daniel Kaluuya performs a non-charismatic character and the impact would be greater with an actor with more personal charm to perform Chris. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): ""Corra!"" (""Run!"")"
575,"1/10 | Probably the best debut from a filmmaker ever. Get Out has elements of the Twilight Zone, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, and The Stepford Wives. Get Out also has some great social commentary on race relations in America post Obama's Presidency. If you were to take the racial elements out it will still work as a horror film. This is one movie that lives up to the hype.

So, the plot is that white people target black people because they want to transplant their minds into black bodies because apparently all black people are inherently stronger, faster, generally better than white people in everything. Yeah. This was nominated for I don't know how many Oscars. Get out! One line from the script is ""You know white people into some crazy sex slave shit."" Yes, it's THAT bad.

579,"4/10 | SERIOUSLY?

Well you seen the trailer (even that is boring) and read the plot so no spoilers here. Premise is like typical MadTV skit. White woman wants to ko visit her parents with her black boyfriend. Wohoo. How is this going to turn out because all the whiteys are racists? Epic twist they seem to be all cool. Then another twist with some cult action, brainwashing hypnosis stuff and shitty jump scares. I watched this movie a week ago and can't honesty remember anything worth remembering. I like Peele and guess he tried to do some sort of social commentary with this flick but falls way flat trying that. In all all the ""twists"" are 100% predictable and the storyline is as ""brilliant"" as ""the Wicker man"". Acting is all the way acceptably average. Nothing spectacular there either. This is not ""wicker man"" bad. Just mediocre horror/thriller/comedy(?) you forget the second you walk out of theatre. My harsh 1 out of 10 rating is bit harsh just to knock down ridiculous 7.7 imdb score. And most importantly this movie got nominated for ""Best Motion Picture of the Year"" and ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role"". effin REALLY?! Oscars have totally lost all my respect. I actually laughed out when I saw this on their nominee list. Had to check calendar it's not april fools day. Obviously this forgettable flick with it's mediocre acting is there just got nominated because other movies don't have enough black people in them to avoid SJWs outrage. I don't care what race/sex/whatever the cast or director is if the movie is good, its good. This certainly isn't."
580,"10/10 | I saw in my local paper that this was a high on the Critics choices from a few months ago, so I put it at the top of my list and watched tonight. The suspense was incredible, and funny bits interspersed throughout to break the tension. I watched at home so i was yelling at the TV! I was hesitant to give it a 10 as I reserve this for my truly great films but on a pure enjoyment level it is the best movie I have seen all year (2017) so I took the plunge. Acting was great throughout. Cheers

582,"7/10 | A superbly created horror that flips the genre on its head. The pacing is immaculate, taking viewers from sheer terror to safe unease like the smoothest roller-coaster in the world. The cinematography is beautifully threatening and the performances by Kaluuya and others are intimidatingly good.

Better yet is a script that features realistic characters who react as the average person would. There is not a single moment that will make you scream about not going into the dark basement or towards the creepy sound. An upstanding horror protagonist who does everything how anyone in his circumstance would, and Get Out is all the more terrifying for it.

Jordan Peele proves himself as a horror director with this mind- blowing debut that mixes politics and the genre film in a way The Purge wishes it could. You'll be lucky if you can get it out of your head any time soon."
583,"10/10 | This movie, although an entertaining movie, is contributing to a growing racism toward white people in the United States. How many evil white people do we need in the movies? We are at a point in time that if this movie was made with Black people brainwashing white people, it would be celebrated, while white people brainwashing black people is what gives it its horror. Enough with this obsession over race. It so typical that it means this movie actually lacks creativity. The worst part is the response white people receive who have shown support for this movie, they are quickly labeled with cultural appropriation.

587,"3/10 | Honestly, I'm not sure what to think about this. It seems that lately, every movie has become a battleground for one political side or the other. Personally, I just want to see a good movie. Is this one one? As far as craftsmanship goes, maybe. Full disclaimer: I watched this because of the Honest Trailer. So, I knew what was the basic premise going to be. However, I expected that the time-frame was going to be 60s or such. Right at the beginning, it becomes apparent that it's Obama or post-obama era (the people have better and newer cellphones than I do). Then it's explicitly stated later that it's post-obama era. Seriously? You want to talk about racism in post-obama era? Every person of color in this movie lives in a more expansive apartment than I do and wears brand clothes. I'm not buying it. This movie is supposed to be a horror but it isn't scary at all, it's more like a comedy about liberals. You can't be scared if there's no survivor for you to be invested in. Imagine if the Alien was made from an omniscient perspective and the Xenomorph would be revealed to be a transsexual libertarian who just wants to make a living. You wouldn't be very scared than, would you? The visuals are very derivative from ""The Skin I Wear"" but unlike that one, it doesn't really draw you in. But all in all, the movie doesn't really suck. It doesn't make much sense either but it doesn't suck. So by today's standards, it's like Avengers: Endgame? It was a time when Hollywood made movies had at least some redeeming qualities. Nowadays, they don't even bother to write a real script or hire real actors."

Liberal America loved this movie because they all believe white america really wants to be black, and we do everything, even steal their souls. Very sad anyone likes this crap.

602,"4/10 | Get Out is a thriller-lovers amusement park. It has a plot, a strong story-line, a good acting, and most of all structure. Movies these days lack in structure and are just like pop-music. Copied crap with repetitive sh*t. But not Get Out.

First of all, this movie is not racist as some reviews may suggest. It is good, high-quality thriller that uses known subject, but gives it an extra twist.

Throughout entire movie, you'll probably be interested and think about ""what is next"". Leaves you expecting, which means you'll keep focuse. Don't look for deeper political meaning, because the director did not aim at that subject IMHO. It is just a well made movie, using race issues in past to make good story-line. Simple as that.

The beginning is simple, the middle is quite a ride and ending gives some satisfaction but leaves you kinda wondering.

P.S: The side-role dude is JUST AWESOME. He is smart, funny and I think he alone should get some movie where he is a star in it.

Worth watching."
603,"3/10 | Writer-Director Jordan Peele has just made a mark as another Great Jordan! Peele's masterful orchestration (directorial and scribe like) of his movie ""Get Out"" will probably be getting in my future ""Top 10 Movies of 2017"" list. This horror/comedy/drama/unique movie stars Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams as Chris Washington and Rose Armitage. Chris and Rose are a biracial couple (Chris being black, Rose being white) who go on a trip to suburbia so Chris can meet Rose's parents; but ""Meet the Parents"" this is not. There Chris sees himself in a plethora of surreal & strange situations, which I won't divulge because I don't want you to ""get out"" of reading my review if I reveal spoilers. Peele not only presents the narrative as unpredictable, perplexing, and magnetic, but he also incorporates various social themes on class distinctions within the picture. A big Kaluuya shot, I mean Kaluuya shout-out goes to Daniel for his excellent performance as Chris. Williams also delivered as Rose. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener nailed their performances as Rose's parents, Dean and Missy. I was especially hypnotized with Keener's work. Other phenom supporting work was gotten out of Caleb Landry Jones as Rose's brother Jeremy; and Betty Gabriel as Georgina, the Armitage's housekeeper. Not its time for you to stop reading this, and get out and experience ""Get Out. ***** Excellent"

Let's get one thing straight, this movie is not going to solve racism. In fact if we followed this movie's rule of dealing with it we would have quite a few dead white people. However, this movie manages to use a popular social topic in our country today and turn it on its heels in order to make probably the funniest and greatest thrillers since Don't Breath.

Definitely worth the $10 ticket.

610,"10/10 | Let me start off by saying this: Get Out is far from a bad film. It is genuinely frightening at times and, dare I say, even genius at some moments. But the film's biggest problem is that it knows it is a step above other horror films and it reeks of self importance. When you take into consideration the political climate in America, Get Out is a film that is hitting at a right time. It is tackling white liberal racism in the upper middle class and it does a very good job at making its point. However, as the film goes on and the scares become more frequent, the film starts feeling cheesy and overwritten even if the performances are truly stunning.

Director Jordan Peele makes the most out of his cast. Daniel Kaluuya gives a truly magnificent performance as Chris while Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener are utterly horrifying as the Armitages. However, Allison Williams is a weak link and is very dry in her delivery which makes her performance comes off as wooden. She is the weak link and it isn't hard to figure it out especially in her scenes with Kaluuya. The story progresses and Williams' performance is slowly twiddled down which then leaves the glaring issue of the script. While the characters in this film are really layered and relate-able, the story they are in is so overwritten and self indulgent that it is hard to consider this the horror gem many critics and audiences are calling it.

The idea of a great horror film is to thrill and scare while making a social commentary. We look back on such films as Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Friday the 13th (maybe), Halloween...these films have weight to them and you don't know it until it's over. With Get Out, we know this is a film with political undertones, we know it wants us to think this is something more than a horror film. In some regards it is, but in most it is just a horror film that thinks it is more important than it actually is. This takes from what Peele is trying to achieve with directing a horror film. Everything comes off being very tongue-in- cheek instead of being straight horrifying and that is probably the most disappointing factor with Get Out. Instead of sinking these political undertones in the writing, Peele makes them abundantly clear and it ends up taking away from a film that is, otherwise, pretty good.

Get Out is a step above your average horror film and features some pretty amazing performances. Despite this, the film suffers from a very weak script that will feel as if you're being hit over the head with political banter rather than having the sh*t scared out of you. Overall, I was pretty disappointed in Get Out but the film does feature some awesome performances and some genuine scares that will be enough to make you wish the film was better."
611,"9/10 | Jordan Peele has been famous as part of the comedy team Key & Peele. It might be a surprise that he directed a horror movie, but he did. And his ""Get Out"" is a horror movie that serves as a biting satire. Basically, it's a look at how white people will often get into black culture but still won't accept blacks as their equals. Think about it: how many white people enjoyed Chuck Berry's songs but would've refused to let him come into their businesses? I don't know that I would go so far as to call the movie a masterpiece, but I won't deny that it's one of the cleverest things that I've seen all year. A mixture of horror, drama and comedy that addresses the continuing racial strife in the 21st century (once thought dead due to Obama's election but made apparent due to murders of unarmed blacks by the police).

Good movie.

612,"8/10 | This movie Get Out was a great film in my opinion. One thing I like about this film is the subliminal messages they try to give off through out the movie. In the beginning of the movie, when Chris and Rose were on there way to meet with Rose's family a deer jumped out into the road and got hit by the car,the deer represented Chris's mother. Chris's mother was killed in that same fashion as the deer was. If you pay attention to Chris he was traumatized by the deer and it reminded him of his mother. Another message Get out was trying to send out was the cultural appropriation. Rose's family and friends were using black people to reach a new discovery in their studies. They were hypnotizing these people to use their bodies to reach another goal. This mission represents the cultural appropriation that has happened in history and modern day. Overall the movie was a really good movie. The humor of the movie was one of my favorite things about it.

613,"9/10 | Get Out (2017)

*** (out of 4)

Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is a successful black man whose girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) is taking him to meet her parents for the firs time. Chris is worried that they're going to be put off by him being black but Rose assures him that they're not racist. At first Chris is welcomed by mom (Catherine Keener) and dad (Bradley Whitford) but soon he begins to realize that something isn't quite right.

Jordan Peele wrote and directed this film, which pretty much came out of nowhere and became a huge hit with critics and it was an even bigger hit with crowds. I don't think anyone would have guessed that this film would have made the amount of money that it eventually did but it's refreshing to see. GET OUT is certainly a rather strange picture and it's one I'd call ""liberal horror"" and I'd also lump DON'T BREATHE into that genre. I think both films are incredibly interesting and the best part about both of them is the fact that afterwards you can have a discussion about their politics, which is something not too common for a horror picture.

For the most part this was a very impressive horror film but I'm not even sure I'd call it a horror movie. I'd probably lean towards calling it a mystery with a pinch of thriller thrown in. The film really plays out like a great episode of The Twilight Zone as we got a terrific setting, a racial undertone and some great performances that keep you guessing at what's going on. We really don't figure out what's happening until there's about twenty-five minutes left to go in the film and I must say that Peele did a wonderful job in the director's chair by having the film hold your attention. Obviously there's a strong screenplay that manages to hold your attention even when there's not much action going on.

The film also benefits from some terrific performances. Kaluuya is certainly wonderful in the lead role as he has a lot of different emotions to play. Not only is he the fish out of water but his character is also given some personal drama that plays out throughout the film. Williams is also extremely good because she's playing someone that you don't know where the character stands. She has to walk straight down the line to keep the mystery going and she does so perfectly. Both Keener and Whitford are extremely good as well as is Marcus Henderson.

As I said, the racial and political elements are right in your face and it's refreshing seeing a horror movie that doesn't shy away from this. The alternate ending is actually a lot better than what's on the theatrical cut but it's easy to see why it was changed. Heck, I'm shocked that the screenplay was even able to get funding. I think the first hour is much better than the final thirty-five minutes and especially when the mystery is finally revealed. I'm not going to spoil anything but GET OUT certainly makes you discuss what it's about afterwards."
614,"7/10 | Greetings from Lithuania.

So after seeing glowing reviews from critics and amazing score here at IMDb of ""Get Out"" (2017) as a horror movie mega fan i was kinda dying to see this movie. After finally seeing it can safely say - this is simply of the very best (actually the best at the moment) movie in 2017 in my opinion. And i saw tons of film this year.

""Get Out"" isn't true terror horror movie, its not even the best horror movie out the at the moment to be honest. What makes this film special is its kinda mind blowing story, jaw-draping writing and perfect directing. Yes, the acting by everyone involved was more then uniformly good, especially by Allison Williams - this is a star making performance. How perfectly, smoothly and involving everything here is done is just beyond me - this newcomer writer / director Jordan Peele should be on a map of every movie goer from now on - it is hardly gets better then ""Get Out"".

Overall, i wan't spoil anything nor i will go into plot details, but do yourself a favor and watch this amazing film no matter what genre you prefer. This is a blast from start till finish, easily one of the very, very best this year so far."
615,"6/10 | Writers are told ""write what you know"". For Jordan Peele, that meant writing (and directing) 2017's ""Get Out"" (R, 1:43), but also stretching significantly as an artist. Half of the Comedy Central comic duo of Key and Peele, Peele has been a comedian since college and is a veteran of The Second City improv troupe and MADtv. The product of an interracial marriage, much of Peele's comedy springs from his observations about race and racial divisions in the U.S., while he also uses his work as a form of social commentary on those issues. His talent and insight have earned him nominations for the Emmy Award and NAACP Image Award (multiple times each – including one Emmy win, an American Comedy Award and a Peabody Award for accomplishments in public media). Peele has also appeared in films (including 2016's ""Keanu"", with comedy partner Keegan-Michael Peele), television shows and internet videos. All of those experiences serve him well in ""Get Out"", a movie which has moments of comedy and carries implications for our racially divided modern world, but is actually more horror film than anything else.

Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is a New York City photographer who is preparing to drive out to the country with his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), in order to meet her parents for the first time. Chris is nervous about how Rose's parents will react to their daughter dating a black man and Chris' buddy, TSA agent Rod Williams (Lil Rel Howery), teases him over the phone about the situation. Rose reassures Chris that her parents are very liberal and open-minded. As Rose predicted, her father, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and her mother, Missy (Catherine Keener), welcome Chris with open arms.

It turns out that they are not racist, but they do make a number of racially insensitive remarks without realizing it and they employ two servants, both of whom are black. Walter (Marcus Henderson), the groundskeeper, and Georgina (Betty Gabriel), the maid, both act so politely that it seems phony to Chris, not to mention that they both speak very strangely. When Rose's brother, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), shows up for dinner, he is even rougher around the edges than his parents. Things get even more uncomfortable for Chris when an annual gathering at the Armitage home introduces Chris to a host of rich white people much like Rose's parents (except for a blind art dealer played by Stephen Root), while one older woman is married to a young black man (LaKeith Stanfield) who looks vaguely familiar to Chris, but who doesn't act anything like the black men that Chris knows from back in his native Brooklyn.

But it's not just the way everyone acts that makes Chris uncomfortable – it's also the things that are happening around him. A police officer whom they meet after hitting a deer on a country road treats Chris like he did something wrong, even though he wasn't driving at the time. Missy, who is a psychiatrist, voices her strong opposition to Chris smoking around her daughter and insists on hypnotizing Chris in order to help him break the habit, even after Chris turns down her offer. She also keeps prodding him to talk about a painful memory from his childhood. Chris talks to Rod on the phone about the strangeness of his weekend and then Chris starts finding his phone unplugged. It also turns out that Rose hasn't been entirely forthcoming about her dating history. I'd like to say more, but I won't because, as much as I've already written, there are still plenty of surprises for the audience to discover.

""Get Out"" is an inventive, insightful and very entertaining film. Although admittedly influenced by ""The Stepford Wives"", what happens in this movie and why it's happening is original and sheds fresh light on the subtler manifestations of racism in America, even from sympathetic and well-meaning people and groups. In fact, it's easy to see this movie as one mainly about racism, but generally, as a Movie Fan, I see it mainly as a well-crafted horror film. There's a certain creepiness about it that starts early, and then slowly, steadily ramps up throughout the film and its appropriately unexpected and shocking reveals. Some of the plot points strain scientific credulity, but that seems to matter little in what is basically a horror fantasy. The film is perfectly cast and terrifically acted. There's also some funny, effective and well-placed comic relief (from Howery's character). That's to be expected from someone like Jordan Peele, but who knew that he would be so good at horror? This movie feels like one of M. Night Shyamalan's better films, with a strong subtext of social commentary. For so effectively presenting these elements and perfectly balancing them, this film deserves the nearly perfect grade of ""A""."
616,"7/10 | Is Get Out Changing the Future of Horror Flicks?

I know the media makes it seem like many white people are scared of darker skin people. On the other hand, there is an equal amount of fear. Some darker skin people are actually afraid of Caucasians.

Now I've never really been that kind of personbecause of all those white women! Horniness will overcome fear. Yeah that's right, I've been up in that game before! I'm just kidding. But in all seriousness, I've never really been afraid of someone just because of the color of their skin. Unless I'm in the middle of a Neo – Nazi rally or a Klan meeting, I don't think I have much to be afraid of.

But for a lot of brothers and sisters out there, being the only person of color in a large group can be a little mysterious at times. A lot of things can come across your mind if you are put into that situation. Such as, ""What happened to everyone else? Am I though token? Are these people going to kill me?"" and that is exactly what goes through the mind of our main character Chris.

""So how long has this been going on — this  thang?""

When Chris comes across Rose's parents, played by Bradley Whitford (Billy Madison, The Cabin in the Woods) and Catherine Keener (Capote, The 40-Year-Old Virgin) let's just say Rose's parents are acting a little off the wall, they're simply acting f*ckin' weird.

I can see where this movie might anger some people. Mainly because it deals with race, race issues, social issues, and other heavy topics. On the other hand, if you truly see this movie, and open your mind, you'll see that this movie is one of the best horror films/comedies in a really long time. I absolutely had a terrific time seeing this in theaters, and I think most people are loving this film right here.

I'm just gonna dive into it, and give you the inside scoop. The movie does a remarkable job at building up tension. It starts off with an awkward encounter with Rose's parents. Then things really flip a switch. It's bloody, scary, violent, has social commentary and it all works. The humor works, the horror works, and the thriller ride is a real journey. The movie is really a great mix up of different genres in one. Later on in the film, we are introduced again to Chris' best friend, Rod, played by Lil Rel Howery (The Carmichael Show).

T.S. Motherf*ckin' A Saves the Day!

Rod truly is the comedy gold of this movie. Everything from his theory on Chris becoming a sex slave for these people to him believing he is the baddest T.S.A. officer on the block.

In a way, I feel like Rod was the character that can relate to the audience. Meaning Rod ask Chris what we would ask our friend if they were put in that situation. Such as, ""How are you not scared of this?"" Speaking of people in the theater, this audience was really passionate, having fun, and really enjoying the movie from start to finish. People in the theater were clapping, cheering, screaming, and this is the type of film that made an audience come to life. One young lady was sitting next to me, and she tapped me, a total stranger, and said to me with a mouth full of popcorn and shiny buttered lips, ""Damn this movie is hella good!""

Hence, the writing, the directing, and the direction is all very artistic, fun, relatable, and I had a great time with this movie. I actually can't wait to see this movie again. When it comes to a perfect blend of horror and comedy, this is what Kevin Smith's Tusk film should have been like.

The comedy doesn't feel forced, it has great tension, an original story, has a message, and there is not one dull point in this movie. I believe Get Out earns

9.5 Out of 10!

So if you haven't seen Get Out, what are you still doing reading this review? Get out and go see Get Out.

""So how long has this been going on — this  thang?"" Long enough for me to close the book on this review for now and possibly get back up in the game of some pretty white women. I'll take the risk. Until next time, thank you all for reading, and or viewing, and I hope you all get out and have an amazing day as always. :)"
617,"8/10 | This was done in the style of the Stepford Wives. Very interesting and very disturbing. It was not an anti-white movie in the same way Stepford was not against men nor marriage. A very creative idea to take one dating scenario and turn it on it's head , instead of a married couple.

It was a fiction based movie in a modern setting. Once a lead character is chosen several other options for consistency follow. The girl from ""Girls"" and the guy from ""Black Mirror"" (15 Million Merits) was a nice casting choice for the leads.

The plot was suspenseful, the pace was lively and the acting was great Horror Film Stuff.

Well done.

Rating : I will buy the Blu-ray."

620,"5/10 | Get Out Directed by Jordan Peele is a horror film which begins with quite a unique story, surrounding an African American man meeting his girlfriend's Caucasian family. The first two acts of the film contain scenes which build so much tension. The start of this movie had me so invested due to how much was unknown. I really built strong curiosity surrounding why things seemed very off. All the performances were great, particularly the main character who was incredibly convincing with all his emotion. Also the cinematography was very nice, containing scenes which are one long take with no cuts. As for negatives there are quite a few. The tone of this film is very messy. I wished the horror really got under my skin. Although it was as if there were constant intermissions with cliche comedic relief. To me this broke all the tension, and really made me question the type of film I was watching. There are also quite a few plot holes, and scenes which really don't have any purpose besides trying to freak out the audience. Once the film reaches the third act, I was really let down by the direction they took. I was expecting a smart and unique revelation. But all I got was a standard messed up horror movie ""twist"". I think all the positive reviews made my expectations skyrocket. I really thought this movie would be insanely smart, but honestly it's really not that special. It didn't impact me the way other great horror and thriller films have. It's a solid and enjoyable film. But it's far from groundbreaking, so therefore I give Get Out a 6. I feel like many will disagree with my rating. If you think you can convince me as to why it is great go ahead. One thing I still don't see is why African Americans were targeted in the film. When it was asked the question was just brushed off..."
621,"9/10 | Went to watch this film after hearing good things about it and seeing the overwhelmingly good reviews on IMDb and rotten tomatoes. But unfortunately I am severally unimpressed. Whilst the film was ok it did not live up to the hype. The plot was predictable and transparent. And for labeling itself as a horror it wasn't scary at all. Though I understand that it's trying to make a point and I feel it does this very well since it's influenced so many people. But overall I would say this film is average and I would much rather reccomend my friends something else.

626,"7/10 | Wondering what it would take for the American movie critics to call out a plagiarized idea when they see it? I mean it couldn't be more obvious. Or maybe the US is trying to say plagiarism is not such a serious offense like it is in Europe. You steal an idea, you change a thing or two not to be very obvious (hoodoo w/ hypnosis) and you capitalize money over someone else's intellectual work pretending its your original creation. We praise the horror and the satire (sure, its a better movie, i agree!) but we miss the bigger picture. ""Great"" stuff.

Otherwise...why the high rating for a movie that did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING until over 1 hour into it? The story dragged and droned and dragged for over an hour. Sorry...Not worth the time or the ratings it's receiving. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because the acting was great.

631,"10/10 | Its too hard to explain how well made this movie was, it is one of the best movies I have seen so far and I hope Jordan peel decides to make a sequel. If I were to describe this movie in 3 words I'd say ""funny, interesting and exciting"". I don't understand how this movie only got an7.8 as a rating but trust me it's a 10. I guess the people who rated it low either hate movies about racism or psychology, or they just enjoy saying things they don't agree on(by that I mean lying maybe for attention or just hatred). Because it's weird, this movie was actually amazing this is not a joke, when it came out it was at 8.4 but then went down, and it even got nominated more than Logan so it's hard to let it go. You need to watch it.

632,"10/10 | It is a very fascinating idea one that has never been portrayed before and which also shows the evils woven into the society! Horror comes in the form of a mystery surrounding the Plot, which reveals itself almost perfectly.

The movie keeps you guessing, and shocks you while unfolding the truth hidden inside the house. Filled with thrill, emotions, horror and mystery, Get Out brings something fresh to the table.

The movie is quiet engaging. Characters are lovable, PROTAGONIST. Acting is superb and direction and cinematography are fabulous.

All in all, this movie is a complete package and you wont be disappointed after watching it. Worth giving it a try. 9 ⭐ out of 10!!!

But the ending is just ... weird. I thought it just disposed of what the movie felt like being setup for. Many scenes outside of the house felt somewhat redundant and empty, not really capturing the atmosphere of the main plot. Still a great movie, just wishing it was building towards something slightly less surreal.

I tend to roll my eyes when I hear of ""Political Satire"" in films, especially so in such a modern context; but if anything - I found all present here to be extremely delicately handled and well executed, with the overall message of the film being put across with the upmost style and tact.

Does what it says on the tin - severely exceeding already high expectations. A great film.

648,"8/10 | Thought about it. For awhile. And this is the genre I decided upon for the super strange suspense flick ""Get Out"". ""Socioracial Horror"". Yep. Pretty sure I just made that up. But that's what I'm going' with.

I'm not exactly certain what Writer/Director Jordan Peele was aiming for message-wise here, only that he succeeds wildly for the most part in crafting an unnerving potboiler vibe right from the ghastly get-go. The hallmark of any top-notch thriller no matter the plot is to keep us guessing, anticipating what in the hell we may watch go down next. Peele does this in expert fashion. And does it in spades.

And if you've seen, or now plan to see, ""Get Out"", please understand that I certainly do NOT mean that as any ""socioracial"" play on words.

The intent resides strictly in the superlative sense."

655,"3/10 | This movie is the second best movie of the year (the first one is Logan), it's a surprise than in this world of sequels and remakes, we can get a good movie from time to time. The score is awesome, and in some parts we have some jokes that helped me make it trough the end because it's full of suspense.

656,"3/10 | Not a bad movie itself-kind of interesting,some good acting,cinematography is fine...but story is ridiculous with too many plot holes-10 or so black people are missing all connected to the same white girl and no one finds it a little bit strange? Anyway,this is propaganda piece which makes it worthless in my book.All whites are crazy,all whites are evil,all whites are jealous at black people cause they have better bodies and so on and so on...this movie pretends to be social satire toward racism but it ends like being racist itself.

p.s. Microsoft obviously spent some money on this movie and boy it is shown-they are literally everywhere...to see someone actually using Bing as search engine was even more weird then all that brains transplantation stuff!

658,"1/10 | As I write this in April of 2017, ""Get Out"" is the best movie I have seen so far this year. First time writer-director Jordan Peele shows a talent for dialogue similar to Quentin Tarantino for using language which sounds like the way real people speak to one another. Rose(Allison Williams) is a twenty something white girl with a black boyfriend, Chris(Daniel Kaluula). The happy couple travel from NYC to a lily white suburban community north of the big city. The good liberal(we voted for Obama twice, ha ha) parents welcome Chris into the family with big goofy grins. Something isn't quite right in Mayberry, as the story unfolds into an almost ""Stepford Wives"" tone. Peeles's script is smart, funny and strikes a perfect balance between comedy and horror. I do not want to give away too much and so I will only advise my fellow movie lovers to sit back and enjoy Peele's excellent rookie effort into the film business.

662,"4/10 | Jordan Peele has described this movie as a ""social thriller"", and in some respects his use of small, subtle cues to build a growing sense of unease borrows heavily from the ""psychological thriller"" genre made popular by Alfred Hitchcock. Part of this film's strength lies in the frank examination of social expectations and nonverbal communication. Chris, the main character sees, and hears many things that bother him and contribute to his anxiety. But because he is in a social situation where awkwardness and stereotypical gaffes are something he expects, he writes off many of his experiences as misunderstandings or coincidences, or of examples of ways in which his own social expectations are out of place. He is unable to clearly verbalize what's bothering him. He therefore overlooks things that, to his friend Rod, are gigantic warning flags, while voluntarily putting himself in a situation where he is more and more helpless to escape when he finally realizes he's in danger.

It may be necessary to draw a distinction between a ""psychological"" thriller, wherein the key factor driving the plot and the decision making of the characters is the internal thoughts and feelings of the characters, and a ""social"" thriller in which the tension comes from the interaction between different characters and the contrast in their expectations as to what behavior is or is not appropriate. Is a particular behavior creepy, abnormal, and worthy of a jump scare? Or is it simply a normal aspect of a social situation in which the main character is not comfortable? The way Chris begins to question and second-guess himself, and the way he starts to doubt his own instincts and intuition, comes almost entirely from the social aspects of the situation he's in.

Unlike many horror films in which the victims do phenomenally stupid things, this film accurately depicts exactly why Chris tolerates what most people would consider inappropriate behavior, and why he stays at the Armitage home instead of leaving. Every single decision he makes is completely understandable, even when it puts him at risk. Frequently even his riskier behavior is the only possible option given his life experiences and his emotional state.

Race, and racism, are omnipresent in this movie and some of it is overt. Chris is treated differently, objectified, and patronized by the Armitages and some of their friends. In the midst of a scene where ""White"" racial stereotypes of ""Black"" people are being trotted out and exaggerated to the point of hilarity, Peele injects a few lines of dialogue with a Japanese character who, ironically, can easily be interpreted as a stereotype. With layer after layer of irony, the film subtly mocks its own effort to deconstruct racial stereotyping.

Lacking the stereotypical gratuitous nudity and sex many people associate with horror, this movie has several violent scenes at the end but is not gratuitously gory. The victim's helplessness, and the casual predatory nature of the villains (who really are Up To Something) is conveyed almost entirely through the acting, which is outstanding. Many horror conventions are turned on their heads, such as who the victims are and who the villain or villains might be.

It is also important to pay attention to the score. The background music for this movie is spectacular, particularly ""Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga""."
663,"1/10 | I had heard several great reviews of this film and saw the high rating on Rotten Tomato - so with my 6th or so friend having gone to see it and raving about it, I finally made the go.

I was definitely not disappointed. The key ingredients of a good thriller, for me, is to have compelling characters, the right amount of humor, jump scenes, and psychological tie together at the end. This movie had that and more.

The director blended enough what the hell is going on thoughts, with funny comic relief to keep me engaged the entire film. I felt like there may have been more room for a few more jumpy parts, but overall this will be a go-to thriller to recommend to people wanting a great flick to watch that will tie together really well in the end.

664,"3/10 | This film is brilliantly unsettling and should leave you feeling inspired to create, even if you are not an artist. I was surprised that Jordan Peele, upon his first attempt at directing was able to capture the essence's of Hitchcock and Kubrick. This movie is a must see for all! Between the laughs and the screams you'll soon find that Jordan Peele is an amazing artist/director!

666,"8/10 | GET OUT is the story of how a black guy—Chris, played by the marvellous Daniel Kaluuya—and his white girl-friend visit her parent's mansion at the countryside. At first sight, his girl-friend's parents seem just fine with Chris being black. But he soon discovers that something is off. The black ""servants"" at the mansion are behaving oddly, as if brainwashed. And as he digs deeper, more secrets about hist girl-friend's family are being revealed.

GET OUT is witty as hell. It deals with racial stereotypes in a funny way, turning them outward and explicit by making racial divides within the US the premise of a horror movie. The script is spot-on, with just enough jokes to keep you laughing, just enough racial subtext to make it cringe-worthy, and just enough seriousness so as to not destroy the suspense. And it is there where GET OUT excels: In many movies, suspense and comedy are mutually exclusive. Not here! GET OUT manages to keep both up and going till the very end.

Mix into this great performances (both on the protagonist and the villain's side), good cinematography, some fun play with US accents, self-awareness of and commentary on horror movie tropes ... perfected with a dash of violence and gore ... and you'll end up with something that's truly unique, managing to deliver many complex emotions simultaneously while still just being outright fun."
667,"10/10 | Get Out is a timely entry in these cynical pressure-cooker of times. It is a piece of compelling entertainment, ensnaring the viewer with a rising intensity of stirring paranoia; it is a sly whip-smart satire of our current world wrecked day in day out with racial tension and inequality. How it never becomes top down heavy and preachy is sheer master-craft.

Part of the fun of Get Out is the winding twists and audacious turns, and a discussion of the plot will rob you of the fun. So I will refrain from doing that and will also not post the trailer. Best to go in blind. Believe the hype.

Writer-director Jordan Peele's debut film is assured and deliciously wicked. Get Out feels like an extended Twilight Zone episode. It is a potent genre blender, pushing many racism buttons, sending them up in a refreshing manner without being preachy. Peele's comedic roots is showcased here and the high-tensioned wire-act is neatly interspersed with some hilarious respites, which believe me, is much needed. Peele also achieved some great tonal shifts as the narrative easily slides out of comedy into horror and vice versa with a snap. I love narratives I can't guess the outcome and even though I could see some twists coming ahead of time, I never felt short-changed because the characters are so well- drawn and the situation so twisted.

Daniel Kaluuya, best remembered as Emily Blunt's sidekick in Sicario and an episode in the excellent Black Mirror series, is outstanding as the deer caught in the headlights. He demonstrated a lot of range and his character arc left me breathless as he raced toward the devastating finale. It is a dazzling performance that will make your blood run cold.

When the ultra-violent final denouement rolled in, I was punching my fist in the air; only the really good ones can make me do this. It is definitely one of the most satisfying endings I have experienced in cinema and Peele has knocked it out of the park with his first film. Cleverly written with a pulse on today's crazy world and deeply unsettling, this darkly funny examination of what happens when you have got nothing left to lose is brilliantly addictive. This is a must-see for anyone who is occasionally reckless, ruthless or just plain psychologically weird, and anyone who loves clever movies."
668,2/10 | 
669,"8/10 | Jordan Peele has really put a good story together in the horror genre, in addition to directing a good cast of established and new actors who in there own right gave this script life. There are many layers to the film in varying subject matter without loosing the main story line. Can't wait to see what Peele does next in this genre. Well worth the watch.

670,"9/10 | Months before the official trailers were released someone sent me a trailer of this movie. After seeing that the writer and director was Jordan Peele I thought that it was a joke. Jordan Peele is a comedian so this must be some spoof trailer for his show Key and Peele. Then months passed and the official trailer was out. No. It's not a joke. This movie is very real and it's not a comedy.

A young black man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), goes to visit the parents of his white girlfriend, Rose (Alison Williams). Already tense enough due to the uncertainty of how his girlfriend's parents will receive him, he finds that many of Rose's parents make racially insensitive comments and the few other black people around behave very strangely. Just why they behave so strange is the mystery that Chris sets out to uncover.

This movie wasn't so much a horror as it was a thriller. It did have its jump scares and an eerie feel to it but I still wouldn't classify it as a scary movie. The performances were on point and the story itself was intriguing. This was a movie in which you could view for simple entertainment or look deeper and make parallels between it and real life. Already there are several articles pointing out some interesting symbolism.

I appreciated both: the entertainment value and some of the deeper meanings to the film. It was well thought out and mixed the pace quite nicely. There was a steady diet of mysterious content interspersed with genuine comedy with a blanket of creepiness over the entire dish. Jordan Peele just made himself a legitimate player in the writing and directing game."
671,"10/10 | As a Key & Peele fan, I'm guessing my reaction to hearing Jordan Peele had written and directed a horror movie was similar to other fans' reactions: ""Oh, hell no!"" or ""Oh, brother!""

Then it was hyped as ""100% Fresh"" according to the illustrious Tomatometer, forcing my hand into getting out into a movie theater to get Get Out. Get Out, a simple title, brings the issue up front: people who endure racial discrimination might feel a need to leave but often do not have a viable option.

Other critics have championed Get Out by comparing it to John Carpenter's They Live, or even The Stepford Wives. That's going far too far. They Live will endure as a classic criticism of capitalism. To be blunt, Get Out is not that iconic or special. It is, however, an important reminder that progressive white America does not have a realistic understanding of what racial discrimination is or feels like. ""I'm not racist"" sounds trite, just as trite as a majority group's opinion on whether or not any particular behavior or attitude is racist.

LilRel Howery steals the show every time he appears, especially when he warns his friend about becoming a sex slave. Progressive whites are probably more worried about losing wifi connectivity or a coupon expiring. The bourgeois teacup and teaspoon become a weapon. Salvation comes from cell-phone flashes.

In Get Out, nothing is as what it seems. It is not as much about racism, but pointing out we often fail to recognize it."
672,"4/10 | From the mind of comedic genius Jordan Peele comes ""Get Out"", a new horror-comedy that delivers the laughs and thrills at a mile-a- minute and generally excels in every department despite a few minor hiccups in the pacing department. Horror and comedy are very unique and strangely similar genres- both very much based on instinctual and visceral reactions (the tendency to fear in terrible situations and the desire to laugh), and it's always a pleasure to see a film that combines them so well together. Add in a dash of all-too-real social satire regarding subliminal racism, and you got one of the better mainstream creep- shows in recent time!

The excellent Daniel Kaluuya and delightful Allison Williams star as Chris and Rose, an interracial couple preparing to spend their first weekend together with Rose's parents. While Chris has some minor worries about what they'll say about their daughter dating a black man, for the most part things seem more- or-less ordinary when the first arrive, save for Rose's father Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford) trying a bit too condescendingly hard to be a ""cool"" and ""open-minded"" guy (""You know, I would have voted for Obama a third time!""; ""So, how long has this THANG been going on?"") and his psychiatrist wife Missy (Catherine Keener) pressuring Chris to stop smoking for health- reasons. But things quickly start to go a little... strange. Especially when it comes to the Armitage's black servants Walter and Georgina (Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel) acting increasingly out-of-the- ordinary and Missy's push to try and use hypnosis to ""cure"" Chris' smoking habits. And soon enough, Chris will discover that despite the idyllic facade crafted by the Armitage household, there are dark secrets hidden away within the home that could spell doom for he and Rose...

Peele proves a more than capable first-time director in this spine- tingling tale, and he loving pays homage to a number of the genre classics that have obviously inspired him while never going to far as to lose originality. With shades of everything from ""The Stepford Wives"" to ""Night of the Living Dead"", Peele is obviously an affectionate fan of old-school horror, and weaves in subtle and rewarding parallels that other fans might pick up on. His eye for composition is quite stirring and I was really taken by some genuinely effective uses of extreme wide and extreme closeups that pleasantly reminded me of some of the greats like Hitchcock and even Sergio Leone in a few key moments. I also appreciated his general sense of deliberation... Peele doesn't feel the need the throw in loud stingers and non-stop jumps to jolt the audience into paying attention. He knows atmosphere is key.

The script is a great deal of fun, and Peele's handling of characters and the subtle racism of old-school societal expectation leads to many moments of pure gold. While he never lets up on the ever-growing and slowly-building sense of tension and intrigue, he injects just enough humor of the film (much of which relates to a delightful character played by Lil Rel Howery) to give the audience breathing room and supply some genuine laughs. The fun that's had with social satire (especially about subtle racism) is a breath of fresh air and adds quite a bit of depth to the film's story. When Chris is told that his being black is ""fashionable"" and ""in"" nowadays by a character who is trying to be nice to him (despite dehumanizing him into little more than a fashion statement), you can't help but both laugh and cringe a little on the inside because you definitely know that's the sort-of thing that all too many people hear in the real world.

The cast is just perfect. Kaluuya is endlessly likable and plays his lead role in a very thoughtful way. You always get the sense that there's a lot going on beneath the surface, even when he tries to play it cool for the sake of his relationship, and there's a lot of really nice moments that delve into his past that give Kaluuya some good material to sink his teeth into. Williams is sweet and likable. I've only really been familiar with her through her singing and music, so it was a very pleasant surprise to see her stretch her acting chops in such a good role. Keener and Whitford are phenomenal in their roles and have a ton of great moments. While you know something is definitely up with them... you haven't seen the half of it until you've seen the film. And supporting roles by the likes of Howery, Henderson and Gabriel (and even a small cameo-role by the great Stephen Root) are exceptionally well played.

Really, the only thing holding the film back from attaining a perfect 10 from me are some very troubling issues I took with the pacing and structure in the film's second half. Whereas most films tend to outstay their welcome and go on for a bit too long... I felt ""Get Out"" was perhaps about 10 minutes too short, and the third act in particular rockets by in a way that made it lose some of its impact for me. There's also a few jarring scene transitions in the moments leading up to the climax that felt inorganic, which also hurt it. The film really has an ideal first two acts... and merely a pretty decent, but not quite great finale.

Still, I can't do anything but give Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" the highest of recommendations. It's already one of my favorite films of the year, and I can't wait to see it again and again.

I give it an excellent 9 out of 10."
673,"8/10 | Seriously, if you've pondered on whether seeing the film or not, please do yourself a favor and go see it. It's worth the admission.

Jordan Peele, known for Key & Peele makes an excellent first impression in his directorial debut. He brings a fresh take on typical horror movies, implementing the obvious, but subtle racial tension and sharp satirical wit.

A young African-American man named Chris visits his girlfriend Rose's mysterious Caucasian family estate, and from there on a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.

In most horror films guys like Chris, exceptionally played by Daniel Kaluuya, end up dead really quick. It's an overused cliché, but it is reversed in this film, and to see an African-American male protagonist front and center is a nice change of pace within the horror genre.

What's also great is that the film showcases his paranoia, he knows something is up, he's not blind to it. He makes the smart decisions and plays it cool, he isn't some dumb protagonist ready to be next on the chopping block. Kaluuya is great at playing a doomed man who thinks he's in control of the entire situation. On the surface he looks confident and at ease, as he has sharp eyes taking notes on everyone's behavior and it doesn't take a genius to figure out something is odd. You're never quite sure what's going on at the girlfriend's home, whether everyone's involved in some sinister plot or if its just some awkward misunderstanding. But it's clear that something is happening, and Chris is the most normal person here, and as the audience member we're not given any reason to doubt him.

Kaluuya also has great chemistry with Allison Williams who portrays his girlfriend Rose. They both get to showcase their moments as a couple together very well, and I'm quite positive they'll get more recognition into furthering their careers.

The characters are fleshed out immaculately, with Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener in their best performances to date. Caleb Landry Jones also has an appropriately, intensely edgy role, a tad bit over the top I might add. Whenever the film needs a short moment of humor, a lot of the film's levity comes from Lil Rel Howery as Rod, Chris' best friend.

In some areas, the film does take its time to get things going, but Peele strategically knows where to add elements into the film to build up the tension. For example he knows where to showcase creepy sound effects and music cues. He successfully increases the level of anxiety, relying upon the fear of something not visible to the naked eye. It is reminiscent in the ways of a Hitchcock or Kubrick film.

Get Out embraces the stereotypes and embraces them very well. Social commentary is very relevant and poignant in the film. Peele allows the viewer to see prejudice head on. When all is said and done, you now have a bird's eye view of what is really wrong with society. The film definitely shines light on the aspect of ourselves that a lot of us would rather not acknowledge or be in denial of. As much as we try to convince ourselves that we're above forming preconceptions and stereotyping, we aren't. Peele uses this as a tool to bleed out anxiety and tension which very much fuels the entire film.

All the slow build up leads to one of the most satisfying climaxes I've seen in a while in a horror film. Peele is the true star of this film. He brings a distinctive visual style, carving out the film's creative path with some dark reveals, addresses the variable levels of racism with subtly, pays homage to some great horror films, and at times very humorous as well.

There have been some quality horror films of this era, Sinister, Paranormal Activity(not the cash grab sequels), The Conjuring, Lights Out, but Get Out is one of those horror films that is intellectually engaging and self-aware. For me it ranks up there with Scream and Cabin in the Woods.

9/10"
674,"8/10 | I always say that horror and comedy have a very thin divide between them. In both genres, you are trying to get an extreme reaction out of your audience, whether it be laughs or screams. This may be why writer/director Jordan Peele, half of the comedy duo Key & Peele, was able to make such a smart and well-executed horror/comedy.

Get Out has a simple premise. A black man falls a white girl, and goes to meet her family. He is nervous about her family's reaction due to the fact that his girlfriend has never dated a black man. As he goes from his comfortable urban setting to the country bumpkin locale of her family's home, he begins to feel unsettled by her family's attitude, and the behavior of all of the African Americans in the area. There are multiple ways in which Jordan Peele deals with modern racism that incredibly intelligent.

Some of the all-time great horror films have dealt with race as a subtext. Both Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of Dead have subliminal racial contexts that take some reading into. Get Out brings race issues into the forefront as the central conflict of the plot. As we of course understand, racism has quite changed since 1968 and 1978, when the first two Dead movies were made. In Get Out, the subtle racism of modern is depicted. The details of this film are what make it executed so well. Throughout the film, small little allusions to stereotypes to slavery are a constant throughout the film, if you are perceptive enough to pick up on them. Peele said that he wanted to make a movie we would all want to watch twice, and he definitely succeeded with his precise placements of minuscule, but important details. Many times, statements we make, we truly do not believe they are racist, even though we are trying to connect and relate to another human being. This film brings these to the forefront, to be examined by its audience. also, the film challenges the stereotypical role of the African American man in the horror movie and tries to change this context within the bounds of the film.

What really helps Get Out is getting Oscar and Golden Globe nominees like Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, as well as rising stars like Allison Williams and Lakeith Stanfield in your horror movie. Many times, studios are just concerned about how they can make a movie for as small of a budget as possible so they can maximize profit. The studio is not concerned usually how good the movie is, as long as it makes money. these shoe string budgets usually do not have the room for great talent in front of, or behind the camera. Maybe Get Out can prove to studios that this talent is necessary to make the horror film great again. as a sidenote, I love that some old white studio heads had to approve a lashing criticism of the subtle racism of white people. Viscerally, it appeals to me for some reason.

Get Out has put itself among the all-time horror greats while being intellectually engaging, and roaringly funny. This probably the best horror comedy since Cabin in the Woods. If a movie makes you hate the ways of the race you were born as by the time the credits role, it has succeeded in its purpose."
675,"10/10 | When an interracial couple decides to take it to the next level, things get a bit uncomfortable.

Chris and Rose have been dating for a few months, so Rose decides that it's time Chris meets her family. At first Chris is a little nervous about meeting his white girlfriend's family, but Rose assures him that her family doesn't care about his skin color. When he first arrives at their estate, things seems to be running smoothly and better than he expected, but after having an odd encounter with Rose's mother, things take a turn for the worse.

This satirical thriller will be sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. The storyline is genius and relevant, while the dialogue is witty and eerie. The film seems to be more of a comedy than a horror, but that's what makes it so scary. ""Get Out"" has an excellent way of making the viewer feel uncomfortable about societies cultural appropriation. The cinematography is clean, sharp, and satisfying. The film's score is definitely one of my favorites. American composer, Michael Abels, is what holds the film together the whole way through. Included in the score, there's some blues, folk, rap, and traditional African chant. The cast was great and genuinely captured the films flow. The relationship between Chris and his best friend Rod was perfect and refreshing—they had the audience cheering from beginning to end.

Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the film, but it was way too predictable for me. Twenty minutes in, I already knew exactly what was going to happen and how it was going to end. I only wish that they kept the concept more on the subtle side and harder to predict. Nothing makes me love a film more than its twists and turns, but unfortunately, ""Get Out"" didn't have any of that. Aside from its predictability, I loved everything else about it. It seems to be a modern-day version of ""The Skeleton Key"" meshed with the satire from ""The Visit"".

This is 100% a must watch.

678,"10/10 | This movie was a good attempt at horror by Jordan Peele, but it was just that, a good attempt. The movie itself was an adequate film, but nothing special. I can't understand the hype of this film. I think most of the reviews I've read from newspaper and magazine publicists are giving this film more credit than what its truly worth. I also think it's just a case of the movie being released during a time of year when no other anticipated films were set to be released.

The movie starts out slow when Rose Armitage, a white girl, takes her black boyfriend played by Chris Washington to visit her supposed liberal minded parents and friends of her parents, and then after many slow reveals, things take a violent turn. It starts out slow with a lot of build up along the way for the big reveal, but the big reveal isn't really that surprising. And the ending falls thin and feels abrupt. None of the scary reveals actually felt scary. The comic relief in the film is low grade humor to lighten the situation from character Chris Washington's TSA friend. Daniel Kaluuya plays his part well, but most of the acting felt flat and the story felt blah. There have been much better horror films released lately. I wouldn't believe the hype of the positive reviews. It really is just an average forgettable movie. I think Don't Breathe from last year was a much more intense and better made horror flick. You'll forget about ""Get Out"" in a few weeks."

684,"10/10 | The plot.

A young black man visits his white girlfriend's family estate where he learns that many of its residents, who are black, have gone missing, and he soon learns the horrible truth when a fellow black man on the estate warns him to ""get out"". He soon learns this is easier said than done.

Interesting concept that is relatively well directed with this caveat -- there are long stretches that are just plain boring.

It's almost as if they had a very short story that they needed to add lots and lots of filler to lengthen this film out.

Unfortunate because it takes it's toll on interest level.

By the time the movie gets to the good part and the twist ending, you already lost interest and it takes an effort to come back around.

Unfortunate."

I hate the emphasis on race and racism and the cheesy metaphors and such throughout... I did love this movie for awhile, but nowadays I just forget about it. The whole story is just stupid and the characters are...ugh.... I am a little ashamed I bought and enjoyed the crap out of this back in 2017.. It's a bore fest focusing on race and racism. If you wanna see a good Blumhouse film, see Don't Breath, Insidious, Split, just to name a few.

688,"10/10 | I made a BIG mistake , I read reviews before seeing this and unfortunately they contained spoilers grrrr - I always try to avoid spoilers and simply let you know whether it's worth seeing or not . Well this is definitely worth seeing . It lives up to the hype and the trailers .

Let's talk about the positives - Acting - superb lead role by Daniel Kaluuya he's come a long way since being a parking warden on Harry and Paul . Can see this $100m plus box office hit from a $5m budget catapulting him into the Hollywood big time . Great supporting roles from the rest of the cast in particular Caleb Jones who's sinister presence was felt in every scene he appeared in . Music - the music was superb right from the ' run rabbit run' opening scene - eerie and atmospheric throughout .

For a horror there probably weren't enough jump out of your seat moments but it certainly was a cerebral horror and had elements of classics such as Wicker Man , The Village and Hostel in there .

Overall this was a good film , it's worth seeing , it's not the best film I've seen but it's certainly not worst . It's above average and will definitely appeal to horror fans ."

691,"10/10 | Best thing about this film is the dog. I was really looking forward to watching it, but it's just awful, less horror, more comedy, ridiculous plot - I use that word loosely - and not at all engaging. Story could have been done in an hour, I have seen better in the Hammer House of Horror series from the 70s! Absolute rubbish glad I didn't pay to see it!

692,"10/10 | Get Out - I genuinely had no idea what to expect with this one. It's a horror movie, but it's written and directed by one of the Key & Peele guys. And I'm not gonna lie, I thought it might end up being a white-bashing couple of hours based on one of the trailers. But it turned out to be a very solid horror flick. The main actor, Daniel Kaluuya, I had only seen on the English show Black Mirror (which is incredible by the way) so seeing him in this type of American role was quite a shift. He does extraordinarily well, showing a wide range of different emotions. And finally I can report that an accent was done well! I never heard him drop out of it. Race definitely plays a big role, but it's not presented in a vicious way. It more just shows the constant foot-in-mouth moments of white people when they're around African Americans. Rather than a hateful approach to the divide, it takes an honest route and pokes fun at it. The movie's theme and underlying story of course go deeper than this, showing the first time director's ability to get this across without just having the white people shouting the n word to show us they're the villains. A smart, creepy, and satisfying social commentary. 8/10."
693,"10/10 | Get Out (2017) is a very well made thriller/horror film. The cast does a great job, especially the parents, Catherine Keener really plays her sedated hypnotist role well. The beginning of the film is ALL about interaction and dialogue that comes into play later on. The chemistry between the actors and the scenes that involve their interaction is all played out very well. The movie then gets more intense and crap starts going down once the star finally figures out what is going on. There are interesting clues and hints that are dropped during the movie that you connect at the end. The ending is well put together too, creepy and climatic. One thing is for sure, you will not leave this film feeling like it was boring or ordinary or stereotypical in any way. And I am sooo thankful for that! I went into this movie wanting it to be just like what the 100% positive reviews were saying. And I was not disappointed in any way. 9/10 for get out.

694,"9/10 | I originally saw Get Out in the theater, February (2017) so glad I did too. I fell in love and now own it in 4K. I was so happy when it won an Oscar, very well deserved and important with the subject matter/racism. I love Caleb Landry Jones, Daniel Kaluuya, Bradley Whitford, and Lil Rel Howery -- all are great actors! There are some awesome scenes that I'd rather not spoil halfway in and some brilliant cult moments that I hope get remembered for many years to come; I love this wild movie!

704,"8/10 | There was a ton of positive press from others about this movie which is totally justified. I watched a single trailer sparingly and carefully avoided reading or watching spoilers about this one to savor and keep my viewing experience unspoiled and I'm glad I did. This may be the best horror movie of not only the year but the past few years. I can say without spoiling anything that this movie combined the best of ""Guess whose coming to Dinner"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" feel. What made the movie even better was that I had some guesses about what was going to happen in the movie but the story hits you with a sucker punch from a completely different direction that we've never seen before. This is an utterly new and different horror experience. It has some dry situational humor but remains an utterly dark and worthwhile horror experience. This is definitely a keeper and worth multiple viewings.

705,"8/10 | I went into this movie with high hopes and it truly delivered and then some. The film allows the viewer to sympathize with the main character in a way that many horror films have tried and failed. There's also hints of dark/awkward humor spread out within the film that either lighten up the mood after an intense scene or reveals a character's true intentions. The film is very suspenseful but there are some really great horror scenes that fans of horror films will enjoy. This film stands out among more recent scary films because it's smart and three-dimensional. This is a strong debut directorial and I can't wait to see what else Jordan Peele comes out with.

706,"7/10 | Get Out is creepy horror/mystery involving hints of great humor and strong message behind the terrifying plot. Daniel Kaluuya who plays the main character Chris Washington does a brilliant job in showing what the character is boldly thinking and does this with uses of thoughts out loud. Normally i would see this type of acting unprofessional, however this fitted in brilliantly with Jordan Peele's style of comedy he wanted to added smartly into the horror. The rest of the cast do a amazing job at giving that uncomfortable feeling Chris is going through. The moment they pull into the drive way of the house it immediately feels scary and that something isn't quite right.

Although some scary scenes were quite predictable and had their fair share of jump scares. The originality was most definitely their and is definitely a completely out there horror we haven't seen for a while. I particularly impressed by the opening scene especially after hearing it was filmed in one take. It put viewers straight into the plot of the film and gives you a mysterious overview of the villain in the film and how it is later shown towards the end of the film. Lots of links between scenes were used to form a great use of intensity that had me trying to hide in my jumper.

LilRel Howery who played Rod a very close friend to Chris completely stole the show with every scene he was included in. He uplifted the film at the perfect moments with great use of humor and had some of the best lines in the script by far. The twist was absolutely perfect and was portrayed at a great time in the movie and was surprisingly unpredictable. It also formed a good transition to start the grand finale of the filming.

The film was not riddled with action and contained a large amount of slow yet interesting scenes that gave clues towards the whole mystery behind the family and house. Jordan Peele was able to enlarge the worldwide problem of racism and had almost everybody thoroughly thinking about how African Americans are still treated in certain states of America that i admittedly wasn't aware of was still occurring.Even though the film showed a unrealistic and paranormal theme. It related effectively with lots of real life scenarios.

In conclusion Get Out was heavily intense, scary and enjoyable film especially considering it was Jordan Peele's first ever film directing. You can definitely tell that the plot was well thought through and i'm excited to see more films by Mr Peele down the line of the film industry. I would most certainly watch this film again and recommend it to anyone."
707,"6/10 | Do young black males in America feel like they're being hunted? The movie ""Get Out"" directed by Jordan Peele was a thriller in every sense of the word. The 2017 film is one that will go down in history for a variety of reasons. The director is known for his show ""Key and Peele"" which is a riot for any comedy fan. Peele has been a strict comedy director for many years—making this film a surprise. I expected this film to be comedic in nature and probably not to thrilling. I waited a couple weeks to see it but decided it was a must after the pop culture following. Every social media account of mine was laced with friends' admiration for this film. With this in mind I went into the theater expecting allusions to our culture's view on race.

To say ""Get Out"" met my expectations is an understatement. I was blown away with the rest of America with this film. There was a perfect blend in this movie: comedy, horror, and thrills throughout the whole 103 minutes. There are allusions to the way young black men must feel in our country—hunted. The throne of privilege young white women sit upon is addressed, and the comedy we all have grown to adore from Jordan Peele is prevalent. In one scene Rose, played by Allison Williams, seems to be standing up for Chris, played by Daniel Kaluuya, by not letting the officer who pulled them over take his license. Rose did this because he wasn't driving so it seems like a noble gesture; the real reason Rose doesn't want the officer to have his license is chilling.

I loved this film. With an astonishing $154.5 million dollar box office grossing and an even more astonishing $4.5 million dollar budget, Peele—a first time thriller film writer and director—has out done himself."

711,"1/10 | This movie blew my mind, I still can't get over the fact that Jordan Peele from Key & Peele actually wrote and directed this film. I don't want to get into much detail here, but I simply love this film. Get Out! has to be (in my opinion) the scariest films I've simply ever seen in my life. I had to watch the film a second time to fully understand what was the message Jordan Peele was sending. The message was so deep that I couldn't sleep at night. Most of the actors in the film were not very well known actors in the film, but they were able to pull it off with an awesome performance. The acting was great, the dialogue was great, the comedy was fantastic and the horror was superb. I have to grade this movie an A+, 10/10, 5 stars.

712,"1/10 | I haven't been to the movies since Captain America: Civil War but this movie here is worth seeing in theaters. I was skeptical at first Jordan Peele directed the movie and he's more of a comedic guy. He showed his comedic side in the movie and it was what a thriller like Get Out needed. It was very satirical and it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. Once the movie ended I told myself that I would see it again in theaters. Best movie I've seen in awhile.

713,"6/10 | Talk about a major batten switch for a celebrity. Jordan Peele who is usually known for acting in comedies, goes the complete other way. However this film isn't all scary like The Conjuring. But what this film does masterfully is building up the tension. This film made me feel very uncomfortable and very uneasy, which is what it's meant to do and does it to a T. In terms of acting Catherine Keener, and Daniel Kaluuya give the best performances. Keener is very subtle and slow with her words making her character very creepy. And Kaluuya gives a frightful and ultimately terrifying performance and plays a character you actually rout for. If you are a horror film fanatic, this is what you're looking for. The only flaws are that the villains are killed off way too easily, making the last fight for survival a weak one. But for the fact that this is Peele's first film to direct, this is as good of a debut as you can ask for. I can't wait to see what else Peele can do. Check it out, or get out! Now to grade. Acting: B+ Music: B Directing: A+ Effects: A- Scare Factor: A OVERALL: A

714,"1/10 | Instead of spoiling anything, I just feel like telling you a story of mine considering race. I have myself been working with movies, and one experience I have is how I needed to find a better lighting guy. You see, as soon as we put a black person in front of the screen, the lighting guy just didn't know what to DO. It wasn't about race or anything, he just couldn't figure out how to make the lighting look good on any black actress. It just didn't work on screen. Now I have been waiting for this movie forever, and I am a white privileged man –however white trash-but I live in a racist underdeveloped country (Sweden, oh the irony) so I found it necessary this morning to just download a shitty cam version of it, and all I can think of is how beautifully lit it is even on a cam version, how the light reflects so well on those ebony bodies even in the dark scenes, their white teeth, their genetic frame and whoops we are back into race again. This movie is very subtle, but always constant, in its remarks on unconscious racism. The direction is ever so slightly off beat sometimes to be subtle, perhaps because it handles issues almost too absurd to handle,but it is truly on the top in the absurdist horror genre right up there with films such as It Follows, The Babadook, and Scream. What this film eventually does is asking the big questions, like where consciousness is even located, which made me respect the script even more. Big ups to Jordan Peele, I seriously didn't think he had this in him, except for the occasional brilliant Key and Peele sketches such as Lil' Homie. Give this nigga an Oscar already. Since these are big questions to handle it never gets too gory, and the slight nuances in the acting is superb. Catherine Keeners evil goddamn chuckle as we remember it from films such as Being John Malkovich is right on spot, and Dexter's sister is brilliant in voice control (the phone scene!). All this being said, there is a contraption men can wear nowadays that with small electrodes let you feel what it is like to have a vagina and go through a period. This movie is as close you can get (apart from wearing a blackface?) from understanding racial tension nowadays. An important and very entertaining movie. You got soul."
715,"9/10 | Jordan Peele proves he's more than just a comedian, that he is an exceptional writer and director. And Get Out is proof of that, it really pulls out all the stops of a great thriller, keeps you shaking through out. After Get Out I believe Jordan Peele will become a sought after writer/director.

Chris(Daniel Kaluuya) a young African American goes with his white girlfriend named Rose(Allison Williams) to meet her parents(Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) in there hometown, and once they finally get there things start taking a turn for the weird, believe me that is far has I should go.

You'll feel like the main character, that where you are, feeling like things are not what they seem. The Creepiness just creeps up on you. Daniel Kaluuya is great, so is Allison Williams. Catherine Keener is awesome, so is Bradley Whitford, looking like Michael Gross from Family Ties. We'll done directional debut for Jordan Peele."
716,"5/10 | I love suspense movies but the good ones, the intelligent ones, and this is exactly that! An intelligent movie with a lot of jumps! It kind of reminded me ""The skeleton key"" with Kate Hudson, but ""Get Out"" liked me better! ""Get out"" is well written, well acted and well directed. You will not be disappointed, go watch it now! I went with my teen daughter and we both enjoyed the most!

718,"9/10 | I'll start by saying that I really enjoyed this movie... and I mostly agree with (so far) the majority of reviewers positive comments about great casting, acting, writing and suspenseful story. I totally recommend seeing this movie... but you WILL be offended and probably not want to see this movie if:

you are ""uncomfortable"" with interracial relationships- specifically between a Black man and White woman. This is actually sort of a theme in this movie, since many such relationships are depicted... including lots of smooching and a sex scene.


you can't handle nearly every White character being vilified as ""evil"" (or racist) toward Black people. This is the director/writer's (Jordan Peele) type of humor, so if you can't handle Whites being ""made fun of"" or stereotyped, then steer clear of this one.


Although there were a few previews for movies that are likely targeted more toward Black audiences (humor and culture-wise), this movie has a broader appeal just as long as the viewer doesn't have a big chip on their shoulder, and ""gets"" Jordan Peele's type of humor."
719,9/10 | 
720,"9/10 | Out of all the possible genre combinations, horror and comedy are probably the most difficult to combine. I'm not sure if first time director Jordan Peele impresses more with that particular balance, or with his ability to effectively display social commentary.

Blumhouse Productions is putting together quite the resume. Their films continue to make bank at the box office, but the diversity of their horror features are nothing to scoff at either. Just in the last few years alone they've made films like The Gift, The Visit, Split, and now Get Out. All original twists on the horror/thriller genre. Get Out may be the most impressive yet.

I always talk about my disconnect with the horror genre and how I don't find much substance with 75% of the films. Get Out turns the genre on its head, doesn't rely on jump scares, is surrounded by tremendous performances, and has a socially relevant script. It is so rare for a film to have a socially relevant message without feeling too political or one sided. I can't tell you how many times I've appreciated what a film or a TV show is saying, but I get turned off by the way it's portrayed. Get Out manages to make an entertaining horror/thriller, while also commenting on unintentional and benevolent racism coming from a white family towards their daughter's new boyfriend, an African American.

It's the racism most people don't normally think about. The people who say they aren't racist because they ""voted for Barack Obama"" or maybe because ""Tiger Woods is their favorite athlete"". Films like 12 Years of Slave and the recent documentary, 13th, are important. But it's films like Get Out that are more effective because they are giving the same message in a different way. Brilliantly written and structured, Peele gets the most out of his actors and times the laughs and scares in an effective manner. Please go out and support an original film like Get Out. You won't be disappointed.

+Laughs and scares

721,"8/10 | This film reminds me a bit of the films of the 80's like ""Fright Night"" comical yet horror base. It does however pull punches in themes and topics that are definitely relevant to the current administration of the US and the people who voted for it. Yet, its more than that. The obvious, is that this film is about racism. The racism in this film is as obvious as a welcome and a smile in a West Texas town. That should give you an idea if you have been to west Texas. There is much to talk about here after watching the film. I can understand why reviewers here don't want to say too much. I do just want to say that you may leave the theatre having a little bit more respect for TSA training.

722,"1/10 | Did I see the same movie everyone else did? When I saw the trailer for this movie a few months back I really didn't plan on seeing it because I thought it looked like every other horror movie and there wouldn't be anything special about it. Then it came out and got raving reviews and I felt like I had to see it. So I saw it and I was a bit disappointed. I loved the first half of the movie, but I kind of felt like the second half missed the mark. I thought the comedy aspect was a little dull and I didn't think the jokes were great. I actually couldn't really tell if the whole movie was a big joke or not. But one thing this movie did do was keep me entertained. The whole movie I was wondering what was going to happen next and what was happening. I didn't think about anything outside the theater and I was completely focused and entertained by the movie, which is what a movie is suppose to do! I would recommend this movie, I thought it was really good, but I didn't think it deserved a 10 star review or that it was the best horror movie of all time. 6.5 stars!

725,"1/10 | I just came back after watching this incredibly intelligent psychological thriller called Get Out. You could call it a horror film as the more generic elements that are seen in a horror film are present in this movie but this film is so much more than just a scary movie. Most of the scenes in this film are centered around the follow four actions (a) denial : Secrets are suppressed: (b) deceit : Secrets are revealed (c) submission : Secrets make the protagonist vulnerable (d) retaliation : Secrets make the protagonist strong

Daniel Kaluuya, the lead actor, has played his role to stupendous perfection. I remember having seen him play Emily Blunt's FBI colleague in Sicario but that time my focus wasn't really on him so I had kind of missed out on appreciating the man's ingenious acting talent back then. This time though, we as an audience are transported into Daniel's mind and we, in a way, view the entire film from his character's confused perspective. Considering how he has conveyed certain emotions in this film, we might as well presume that he could be in the race for a Best Actor Oscar Nomination next year. Yes, he is that good.

Can anybody who saw this film believe that this is Jordan Peele's debut film as a director ? If this is what his first film turns out to be, I am confident he will go on to become one of the greatest auteurs Hollywood has seen till date. I am so happy that this movie has minted so much money at the box-office. It deserves every penny it has earned. I have patiently waited for this film to release and now that I have seen the film, I can surely tell you that my patience has paid off. ""Get Out"" of your homes and watch the movie right now"

Guys... it's just a movie. I think you'll find black people have had to put up with negative, racially biased imagery in the name of entertainment on the big screen for decades.

Get Out is an addictive slow burn and it was great fun trying to figure out what was going to happen to our hero, very well played by Daniel Kaluuya. The film packs in some good, genuine scares but also has a fair share of humour. Good combination. Story wise it reminded me somewhat of The Stepford Wives but it is also quite original. Great stuff, I'm looking forward to seeing Peele's latest offering, Us.

There were many things throughout the movie that foreshadowed the direction of the plot and things throughout the movie symbolized things in real life. It's not only a movie that is supposed to shock the viewers modern perspective of racism in today's society and how someone could get away with the atrocities committed in this film. If you pay attention closely to the concepts mentioned in this movie you can get a lot more out of it then just the face value

730,"3/10 | ""Get out"" is a movie that came out last year and is directed by first time director Jordan Peele. This film is about an interracial couple between a black man (Daniel Kaluuya) called Chris and a white woman (Allison Williams) called Rose, and now Chris with Rose go on vacation at the house were there parents live . In that house Chris meets Rose's family and he doesn't feel so comfortable in this environment, he feels awkward and weird and that is meanly because he is black. And later on in the movie we find out some deeps secrets about this family and maybe some dark stuff is going to get him.

Now look, before i saw this film i was really excited, because i watch some of the review from professional critics and they were saying that this film was a masterpiece, a unique experience. In Rotten Tomatoes this film has 99%. So this film instantly went into my radar but i didn't have the chance to see it until this year. And now the Academy Awards nominated this film for four Oscars including Best picture, director, actor and screenplay. This film supposedly had all positive, and now i got the chance to watch it and...well, this is my viewpoint.

I don't hate ""Get Out"", i think it is a good movie, but i don't think it is a great movie. I was kind of disappointed with this film to be honest. But let's talk about the positives things first.

Daniel Kaluuya gave a terrific performance here, thought out this film we see this character progress and change, and i did care about him in some of hard-core scenes, he did a good job. Jordan Peele's direction was good, there are some things in this film that kind of reminded me of the way Stanley Kubrick directed his films. From the way the opening scenes were going along i was enjoying it. From the way the shots are made and the amazing score, it feel like i was watching a horror film from the 90's. The tension and the suspense surrounding this house and this family is very well done and when a character is in danger you feel that danger. This movie also knows how to make the comedy pop, in movie like this you expect to see the scary things pop out , and this movie does that, but also knows how to make the film funny at times. And you laugh when you are suppose to be laughing, there is not weird sentiment of: We should be laughing or should be scary? - The film doesn't do that.

That is what i loved about this film, but, as always, this film has flaws. I think that the major problem that i have with this film is the tone. This film for the majority of it is a suspense movie, things pop out, weird stuff happens. But in the final scene of the movie, it feels like a completely different film. I not going to spoil it of course, but for me just didn't work and i felt that the end of the film was kind of messy. Another flaw with the film for me is LilRel Howery's character. In this film he plays a friend of Kaluuya's character and he is always talking in the phone, and for the majority of the film his character was very funny and Howery was doing a good job as this character, i felted that by the end is was useless. I mean he does things in the movie for sure, but he didn't added to much to film beside some funny jokes and thats it. I also felted that this movie was a little too long, and there are some scenes were Chris goes out of the house to take pictures of things because he is a photographer, and from that scenes, i'm out. There are boring and it doesn't help too much to the film.

Guys, like i said at the beginning of my review, i don't hate this movie. But i thinks is getting a little overrated. The hype and excitement for this movie is putting this film very high and in my opinion it doesn't deserves it. My best way to describe this film is comparing it with another film i saw a couple years ago called ""American Sniper"", that film got a lot of positives reviews, got academy awards nominations, and it was put as an amazing war film. But when i saw it i was kind of disappointed with that film too. That is my exact feeling with this movie, for me ""Get Out"" is 2017's ""American Sniper"". Is a good film for sure, but is not a great one. But as always i'm just giving my honest opinion here. If you loved this movie, good for you, if you hated this movie, good for you also, all the opinions are welcome here. For me this was good horror movie and i had fun with it at times, and because of that i'm going to give this film a 7/10."

732,"1/10 | OK, we all know what means to be a racist but this is another story in comparison with this film... In fact, we watch a movie that's really obvious what is going to happen every minute after minute and that's boring! As about the director, he seems to think that white people are like monsters and blacks are cool and dudes... It's really funny how bad and not realistic builds his characters and how predictable the script is. In general, he does the same thing he accuses white people do! Bad white people are looking for black servants, if this is not a cliché, what really is a cliché??? And how stupid is the fact that all the white behave the same? White people are not a community, in the real world, there are good white people and bad white people. Rich white people, poor white people. Beautiful white people, ugly white people and the opposite. There are good black people and bad black people! Rich black people, poor black people etc etc... In general, if you think yourself as a smart guy or girl, avoid watching this movie! It's really meaningless and disturbing (and no, i am not a member in Ku Klux Klan!!!).

733,"1/10 | Watched this movie with my friend and we had no clue what the movie was about when we entered. We just sat in the theater, and watched. After watching the move, we've been talking about it the last 3 days.

All these sensitive people are pretending that the movie was trying to prove something or is insulting to white people. The movie isn't trying to prove or show anything. It's just a movie. No one listen to those people who thought it was misinterpreting of white people. Those people just want to complain about something.

The movie doesn't use Cgi monsters or demons to make it scary. What makes the whole movie scary is that they make every character so awkward and sketchy that it starts creeping you out. What I find makes the movie stick with you after, is when you realize that everything progressed in a realistic way. For most of the movie, you don't know who's the real bad guy. Also, the main character knows something is up right away. Most horror movies are just a repeat of the main character ignoring all the crucial clues to get out. You realize the main character did everything he could in this movie, which makes the movie seem so real.

In conclusion, If you just watch the movie and forget about all that stupid slavery and white family talk, you'll enjoy it."

Another slam dunk for Racism. Good job.

735,"6/10 | I did not like this movie. Let's just say this movie angers me, a lot. Like a whole lot. I am going to say this now and especially more than once: Hollywood needs to go back to being apolitical. Sorry I was just joking. I said that only once because I don't want to be accused of a being a racist. This movie is proof, that we are never going to see anything in the horror genre that isn't propanganda ever again. Also I find it funny that someone is going to have an irrational and violent problem with my negative opinion about this movie. Huh. No coincidence at all when it comes to the very liberal-leaning side I agree with to be trying to turn itself fascist, racist and sexist.

736,"1/10 | Jordan Peel's writing and directing were promising. I expected a hilarious horror movie, which I like a lot. Or at least (according to high ranking on IMDb) a very good horror movie. None of these. The first thing – this is not a horror movie. Maybe just a little bit. The second thing – this is not a comedy either. This one is too serious for a comedy. There were some jokes, but I didn't think the jokes were funny enough. I'm not an American, and sometimes I enjoy some little racist jokes in American movies. But all of these were so much stereotyped and clichéd According to what Jordan Peel said about this movie, he was inspired by the Night of the Dead (1968). As to me, this was more a poor Jango remake. Pros: Acting is very good. Story looks original. That is it. Cons: It's not a Horror movie. Not much of Mystery genre here too, because it's too obvious. Thriller – a little bit. Not funny. Some poor pacing. Writing sucks too much.

740,"7/10 | This was pretty awful! I found myself giggling throughout this movie for the wrong reasons! None of the characters were believable especially the family. Like the father or son - you just wanted to give them a slap but only because their characters were ridiculous! It was so over the top it just oozed cringe. The main character did not have anything to like about him.

That said, I guess some people will love it, but if you have any form of intelligence you will see its flaws.

As for it being a horror movie - there were maybe two jumpy bits in the entire film. Nothing creative - just a loud string staccato out of the blue to keep your heart at check.

The only good thing about this movie was the hot girlfriend! played by Allison Williams. I predict she has a great career ahead of her.

Watch it if you want a giggle - but don't expect anything exciting!"
741,"10/10 | I wasn't sure when I saw the trailer. It had the potential to be one of two things, either a very clever psychological thriller, or a puff piece telling us how all white people are evil.

I'm glad to report, that it's the former. This is a cracking film.

The set up; a young black guy is about to meet the family of his white girlfriend for the first time. He's a little apprehensive, but she assures him that it'll be fine, her parents are anything but racist, in fact her dad would have voted for Obama for a third term if he'd been allowed too. But, when they get there, things don't seem quite right, it's hard to explain why, but something's definitely wrong.

Daniel Kaluuya (nice to see an English guy in an American film not playing the bad guy) plays Chris, our poor unsuspecting boyfriend. He is the lynch pin to the story, everything revolves around him, and he's superb. Allison Williams plays Rose, the girlfriend.

If you've seen the trailer you'll know that Rose's family live in the whitest of white neighbourhoods, the handful of black people that do live in the area, seem to be acting very oddly indeed.

This is another film with a small budget. There have been a few recently, and I'm starting to believe that some films just spend money for the sake of it, sometimes at the expense of telling a story. Get Out cost somewhere around $5,000,000 to make. As I write this, it's apparently taken more than $130,000,000 in the USA alone. This shows just what you can do with a well written script, some good acting, and some high-quality production values, if you have all that, then you have a really good piece of work on your hands. There are also very few special effects in this film, and those that are used, are very simple, you could probably recreate them on your phone. The film relies on its astute writing, and that's a great thing.

I was just asked if this is a horror? No. I don't care what IMDb says, I don't care what anyone else tells you, Get Out is a thriller, and a good one at that. There is very little in the way of blood and guts violence, it's all about atmosphere, about a palpable creepiness factor. There are points where it's actually hard to watch. There was also one moment that springs to mind, that caused popcorn fly around the theatre, but even that wasn't a horror moment, it was a great use of sound.

The story is a good one. The production values are lovely. It's creepy, it's funnydid I mention the humour? The interactions between Chris and his best friend Rod (LilRel Howery) are wonderful. They might be a little over the top at times, but if you took this situation and transposed it into real life, then it would be pretty surreal, it would be over the top, so oddly, those moments fit in beautifully with the rest of the film.

Get Out isn't just Chris on his own, it's also filled with a litany of wonderful performances. Everyone portrays their character perfectly. Roses parents walk a fine line between seeming awkward and menacing. Her brother is an off the wall loon. The other local white people are so odd, even for rich white people. As for the few black people that Chris meets whilst he's there, wow, they would make anyone feel uncomfortable.

The score is powerful, I can't think of a better way to describe it, it adds so much to the feel, to the atmosphere. The story moves along at a good pace, there isn't time for you to switch off or get bored. In fact, the story is key here, you think you know what's going on, but things aren't quite what they seem, even in a film that is based around the concept of things not being as they seem, and the film is clever in the way that it let's go of its secrets, you find out when Chris finds out, because of that, you really feel a part of the narrative, it draws you in.

I was worried that this was going to be a film that states that all white people are racist, and this is evidence of how far they'll go. But its not, it's so much more than that.

I don't want to go into details, but there are moments when you're thinking ""how are you going to get out of this one Chris?"" It brings out genuine intrigue, it makes you think, it keeps you on your toes.

I really liked it. I'm not going to do what a friend of mind would do, and scream ""it's the film of the year!"" from the highest point I can find, but it's defiantly up there as one of the best of the year so far. At 104 minutes, it's not a very long film, but like everything else about it, it seems just right.

This is well worth watching, in fact I'd say you're an idiot if you pass up the opportunity to see it.

A wonderful film."

743,"9/10 | Holy crap this is a good movie. Admittedly, it's been a little while since a down and out great film has graced the screen with its presence; and longer still since a great, mainstream American horror movie has so effectively clutched the collective pearls of moviegoers across this country. Thus sounding off on this film might just be the product of being starved for truly awesome content. Still, the nerve of this movie; the brazen, gargantuan balls of this freaking movie – they're a thing of beauty.

Those who have glanced Get Out's chilling trailer will no doubt know the setup. A black man named Chris (Kaluuya) is brought to the childhood home of his white girlfriend (Williams) in order to charm her upper-crust bourgeois parents. She insists there will be no issues, though it's obvious to Chris and everyone else in the room she's being just a tad naive. Consequently when the couple drives up to the stately family manor on the lake, he suspects little other than the usual barrage of forced, vaguely racist pablum. Yet the longer he stays, the more Chris notices everyone around him seems to be acting rather peculiar; including and especially local blacks who behave more docile and compliant than he's used to seeing.

Using razor-sharp social commentary, quick-witted humor and good 'ol fashion suspense; Get Out has all the hallmarks of an above-average, turn of the century horror film. It balances its blunt themes with a lot of expressive imagery and a consistent tone of protracted, off-kilter foreboding. Between Catherine Keener's hazy somnambulism and Bradley Whitford's subtle coaxing the movie quietly spins on an ever tilting axis of weirdness. Every time that spin slows or the film's center conflict starts to wear thin, we're treated to the bizarre, show-stopping conduct of Betty Gabriel, Marcus Henderson and a particularly good Lakeith Stanfield to keep everything head-cockingly strange. And at the front of it all is Daniel Kaluuya who remains understated throughout, though his smirk can't help but channel Sheriff Bart's in Blazing Saddles (1974).

The obvious comparison here however would be The Stepford Wives (1975), which attempted to do for gender politics in the 70's what Get Out does for racial politics today. The difference here is while one faltered in the realm of active, engaging storytelling, this movie keeps use glued to the screen from start to finish. Its escalating stakes and clever little setups and executions become the glue that holds Get Out together as it wades through the treacherous waters of third-act fatigue. Instead of veering bigger and louder like A Cure for Wellness (2017) does, Get Out keeps its tone and relies on its atmosphere and those sweet, sweet payoffs to tickle your brain and keep you invested.

And boy is this, a tense and engrossing film. It aptly juggles all of its various mission statements in a way that is both enthralling and surprisingly polished. Director Jordan Peele (of Key & Peele fame) slips into the directors chair as if it were a second calling. His technical prowess is reminiscent of early Shymalan only with narrative twists and turns that feel organic instead of back-breakingly absurd.

His freshman film is liable to leave appreciative audiences with a gregarious feeling of catharsis while leaving the rest of us in a state of shock. As for me, I left feeling I have witnessed a movie about as subversive as Brotherhood of Death (1976), made by a director hell-bent on proving that comedy, horror and social awareness are not as far apart as you'd think."
744,"9/10 | I just saw Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" last evening in my local theater and I was blown away by how clever, funny, insightful, and of course unsettling it was. It was deliciously weird, eerie, and clever from the very first scene to the last, as I sat transfixed by the events occurring on the screen. Watching the trailers and seeing the first two acts of the film made me think something quite different from what the film actually turned out to be, and I have to commend Peele for being able to pull that off so well. It's rare that my predictions for the ""twist"" or finale to a movie are so off the mark!

But focusing on the plot itself, it follows a young black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), who is actually British in real life but I never would have guessed had I not seen interviews with him, another testament to his incredible acting prowess, and his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) who have been dating for five months and decide it's time for Chris to meet Allison's upper class, bourgeois-type parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) who live on a large family estate in an affluent suburb. This affluent suburb also happens to be the location where several black people, mostly men, have gone missing for many years, vanishing under mysterious circumstances. Chris is a bit hesitant and nervous because Rose has apparently not told her parents that she is dating a black man, but she assures him that everything will be fine and they are definitely not racist.

However, immediately after they arrive, Chris quickly realizes, more and more over the course of his little ""visit"", that they may not be overtly racist they do hold certain views towards black people that are a bit odd to say the least. Coming from a satirical perspective as Peele, who also wrote the film, has stated, Chris, and indeed the audience, isn't sure how to take some of the things they say, whether or not they are just snide, off-hand remarks or hinting at something more sinister going on behind the polite, cheerful, Stepford-esque facade. In addition to the family itself, there are also two black servants, Walter and Georgina, who also seem incredibly ""off' as if something isn't quite right in their heads. They seem too polite, too well-spoken, and too ""white"", for lack of a better term, to Chris, who nevertheless tries to maintain his composure and hide his true thoughts to his girlfriend, and the family in general.

Unfortunately, as Chris soon finds out, he has every reason to feel paranoid. At a garden party, another black man who seems oddly familiar to Chris, temporarily snaps out of his robotic persona and desperately screams at him to ""Get Out!"" before it's too late. He quickly realizes that something is terribly wrong and that his very life, or at least his mind, might be in jeopardy.

I have rarely seen a film where just about every single member of the cast, from the main protagonist, antagonists, and side characters give outstanding performances, performing all the little nuances and quirks of their character to an absolute T. This definitely includes Chris's friend Rod (Lil Rey Howery), who provides most of the comic relief of the film, but is also able to carry on the more dramatic scenes effectively. Also, I can't forget to mention the amazing score for the film, which is a mix of blues, funk, and a truly haunting Swahili folk song which plays over the opening and end credits.

An absolute treat from start to finish, and aside from a few clichéd horror movie moments here and there, a true marvel of cinema. Definitely the sort of film to watch at least twice, as once you know the twist, you can go back and see the film from an entirely different perspective, and all the confusing pieces of the surrealist puzzle fall into place. That's all folks!"

GRADE: B

THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED

IN BRIEF: A scary but formulaic horror film that has more to say than just ""Boo!""

SYNOPSIS: An interracial couple visit the future in-laws with disastrous results.

JIM'S REVIEW: There is something decidedly off from the first moments of Get Out. An eerie feeling of dread and doom that follows its tale to its bloody ending. Critics have lauded comedian Jordan Peele's mash-up of various film genres, calling it a satirical political horror thriller And as the film's writer and director, he has successfully blended these elements most astutely. But, in his first feature, he still follows a safe formula that has been seen countless times in many other thrillers. It is not as original as reported, but it is highly entertaining.

￼Racism is at the core of this film and it is so subtly layered in the writing, direction, and performances, although script-wise, it loses its cleverness around the midway point and the twists and reveals were not so surprising to this reviewer.

Chris and Rose (Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams), an interracial couple decide to visit the Armitage family in the affluent countryside, a picture perfect community with no real diversity in sight, except for the few black servants who tend to their needs of their employers. Rose has not told her parents, Dean and Missy (Bradford Whitford, Catherine Keener) that her boyfriend is black, but assures Chris that they are an understanding liberally-minded family. He has no need to worry. Wrong, of course.

￼Paranoia quickly set in as Chris realizes that some of the town's African-American residents demonstrate odd behaviors and appearances. In the Armitage household, their slightly off-kilter son's behavior, Jeremy (Caleb Landry Jones), may also be misleading. The Stepford Wives / The Most Dangerous Game vibe is more than intentional as tensions begin to slowly build.

Get Out sends up that well-to-do white class privilege and their carefully hidden Trump values. Mr. Peale doesn't shy away from today's divisive climate and uses gallows humor to make his point. His sense of irony becomes grim as the horror elements begin to seep into the plot. His direction is skillfully handled as he creates the right atmosphere and rhythm for his film to jump-start the scares. There are plenty of well deserved jump-outta-your-seat moments to enjoy.

￼The actors underplay their roles which makes the film more disturbing and effective. Mr. Kaluuya is very good as Carl. He is instantly relatable and his nuanced performance is the major catalyst for the film's success. Ms. Williams has a nice counter balance as his girlfriend. Both Mr. Whitford and Ms. Keener, two always reliable actors, are subtly discomfiting as Rose's odd parents. But the standout performance is given by Betty Gabriel as Georgina, who simmers with restrained creepiness as the loyal maid. There is also fine support by Marcus Henderson and LiRel Howery, who contributes the needed comic relief to diffuse some of the tension.

￼The moviegoers in the theater were totally involved, extremely audible in their reactions to the action and gore. This demonstrative twenty-something crowd whooped and hollered their approval at every killing. They applauded numerous times at the bloody mayhem and laughed wholeheartedly at the comic relief sprinkled throughout the film. The film made the right impression with its target audience who all shared in the communal tension.

Get Out is a real crowd-pleaser, but the film is not breaking any new territory as many reviewers have suggested. It's just a well crafted suspenseful, if unoriginal, horror thriller which establishes Mr. Peele as a promising director. So get out, see this film, and have some fun!"

747,"9/10 | Get out was a movie that never hit the mark the trailers portrayed. The movie had some Ill-placed humor throughout. This humor not only pulled the viewer out of the story, but also felt forced and did not add to the plot. The movie was not over-the-top scary, but did had its share of suspense. I think the majority of the acting was superb and the cinematography and accompanying scores really set the stage for what could have been a great movie.

The movies weakness lies in its storyline. The movie propagated the agenda for racial discourse by portraying white on black crime. This weak plot never allowed the viewer to become fully engaged. This shallow storyline at no point left the viewer feeling satisfied.

I think this movie missed its mark entirely. It could have been a big hit if the story was more fleshed out with a different focal point. I enjoyed parts of it, but would not recommend it or see it again. I think A Cure for Wellness, which was released a week before, did a much better job of engaging the viewer."

750,"8/10 | What an outstanding original story! It's absolutely brilliant! I rarely watch horror movies, because I generally find them too mindless. But not this one. This film is creative, it's intelligent, and it's slick. It's an amazing package for a horror movie! I really felt the terror as the story unfurls in front of my eyes. Very effective execution based on a most original idea!

751,"4/10 | I am all for racial equality. We are all men and should treat each other that way. And that said, there are better movies on the theme of racism. Theme of racism in ""Get Out"" feels forced and is even pure cringe at some times. And at one point in the movie, when I figured what was plot about, I was like: ""What? Really?! That's... What?!"" ""Get Out"" is a decent thriller and I would lie if I told I wasn't interested and that I didn't want to know what will happen next. Scenes are very well put together. Daniel Kaluuya and Lil Rel Howery give some great performances to the movie and their communication serves as a comic relief to what is essentially ""very serious and dark movie wannabee"". They make this movie so much more enjoyable that watching it without them is hard to imagine. I give ""Get Out"" 7/10, and that is only because of the said performances. As I said, it's a decent thriller, but horror it is most surely not.

752,"8/10 | How'd this happen?

I don't know how to *not* spoiler this -- rather than dance around the issue, inherent in the premise -- but, for that matter, what is it about this movie that isn't supposed to have a ""charge"" about it because it's social commentary?

Years after Toni Morrison's novels first appear, years further still after The Last Poets and Ishmael Reed, etc., this is apparently supposed to be an appropriate mode of discourse for dealing with ""Black Lives Today.""

I say this because, the movie's not that much fun. It deflates once you leave the Twilight Zone-esque stuff out and try to look at it as social commentary (implausible), and it also doesn't stand on it's own because it has to function with the ""thriller"" aspect or it's no go.

All early '90s cinema grappling with black, particularly inner-city-life existence -- good, bad, indifferent, in terms of successfully doing so, let alone reception -- has lead to THIS?

Why is this movie so great?

Part of it being ""palatable"" (but not without the quotes around the word) is why I feel myself balking at it.

""Can't I just sit here and watch it?""

The answer is apparently no.

I have to think, somehow, it's ""important.""

And that's why I can't ""like"" it."
753,8/10 | 
754,"7/10 | I gave this film three stars because you have to acknowledge the level of skill that goes into this movie. It takes real subtlety in the earlier parts of the film to make a big deal out of every little thing that happens, to justify the race-based fear-mongering this film is really going for. Ironically this film is itself very racist, but it cleverly sidesteps this by creating a fear based narrative that justifies their racism. Props to them for that, not since Goebbels have such effective scare tactics been used. Of course it's still deeply racist, so to hell with that

755,"7/10 | When the promotional TV spots for this were shown in commercials, I don't think I thought too much of it; probably believed that the movie wouldn't be so successful, given how many horror movies (with few exceptions) have been failures the past couple years. So I was quite surprised to see how big of a hit it became -- ""100% on Rotten Tomatoes,"" said one of the commercials for a brief period.

Still, I didn't see it until towards the end of the year on DVD (after a long wait on the hold list from the library). I went into it as vague as possible - I only knew the basic premise, that there's something weird about the family, and that's pretty much it. I paid as close attention to the dialogue, and was along for the ride as Chris, the main character, kept picking up all these off-putting things about Rose's family, servants and party guests. I also kept wondering if Rose knew of her family's intentions, or if she was really clueless. As we got to the twist/reveal, as messed up as it was, I saw the social commentary in it.

The ending, I felt was a tad weak; I soon learned that it was originally going to be very different, if not depressing. While I totally understand and appreciate why Jordan Peele decided to change it to a more hopeful one, his original ending would've definitely been more impactful (this is quite apparent by his comments in the audio commentary).

After I finished watching it by myself, I was eager for my parents to join me for a second time on the weekend. This is one of the few times I bothered checking out the special features - in fact, I watched all the deleted and extended scenes and interviews! I also love the theme with the eerie chanting that plays over the opening and ending credits, and have re-listened to it on YouTube.

My family doesn't understand why love this movie so much. I watched for a third time on HBO yesterday, and am thinking of buying it on DVD. My mom thinks it's just because Daniel Kaluuya is handsome, but I've explained it's because you pick up on things by seeing it again, and that's obviously one of the reasons audiences kept going back to see it in theaters.

It's definatley a much creepier movie than I initially thought whenever I think back on it. Another interesting thing is that I saw this just a month after reading/seeing My Friend Dahmer and learned about Jeffrey Dahmer; it shouldn't be a coincidence that Dahmer was briefly brought up in this (by the hilarious Rod), he was undoubtedly one of the influences to this story. I'm pretty impressed that this is Peele's directorial debut, after having only worked on comedy; I haven't been familiar with him before, but now, I'm excited to see what he'll do next (he's going to work on a Twilight Zone reboot)!"
756,"1/10 | The films should have been called ""white chicks are dangerous"" Plot stupid story, even worse I tried to explain what i didnot like about movie but reveiws stoped due to nature of what movies about. The best actor was the friend who worked out everything hes like Einstien and basically smartest loudmouth in film history. The same actor also shines in birdbox and was killed off way too soon in that movie which was a shame. The main actor played parking pataweyo in Harry enfield's show in uk about being a black traffic warden. Their is no way he should have been nominated for best actor in this film. The cup stiring scene was a direct copy from once Upon a Time in America 1984 but this time its about being hypnotized. The film also has feeling of hostal 2004 which was similar to film with women luring men to danger. The film also goes against genral thought that old people are racist, instead they want to be black a line used in movie. Its like a really bad B- movie comedy that people in holywood think is oscar worthy.

759,"6/10 | It would be wrong to say that this is not a good film, unfortunately one that has been over hyped. If I had watched it without knowing the hype and rave reviews, it would likely have earned an extra star rating.

No need to discuss the plot but the film sits in the mystery/horror genre slot. I thought it was a comedy-horror going in, but it isn't. In fact the undertone to the film has quite a dark and socially challenging agenda.

Though is the film a new fresh take on the horror genre as some reviews have suggested, well, erm, no. All though there is some astute direction in building the suspense, Get Out does end up following the standard horror narrative. The last 25 minutes is particularly typical as our central character desperately tries to 'get out' of the bad situation.

Would still recommend watching this film, just don't get too excited."
760,"10/10 | Hypnosis is what got me into even looking at this. it's a scientific phenomenon that's completely misunderstood even within the science community... and movies don't help. in the trailer it's clear that this movie is just keeping the status quo of complete ignorance from the media and movies. i didn't want to get into specifics, because i really enjoy to know them while producers don't, so they can't easily fool me, but i'll do it anyway: knocking someone unconscious by hitting on the head is widely known to be completely wrong. cheers!

761,"1/10 | Get Out is rare film, you just have to go and see it yourself to know what it is; a description won't really do. It is a perfect combination of horror and dark humour; with an underlying symbolic meaning that lingers in the mind for days (all without being too preachy). From the opening scene to the last, the film is utterly captivating. The cast is spot on. If you liked ""Drag Me To Hell"" (2009), you'll love this!

762,"10/10 | For some, there's really nothing more terrifying than a gaggle of well-to-do and overly polite white people. In Get Out (or ""Guess Who's Coming DinnerAnd Possibly Never Leaving""), comedian-turned-director Peele makes this abundantly clear, reminding us that racism often doesn't show up in outwardly obvious hatred, but in an insidious need to understand and control ""the other"". With breathtaking moments of social adeptness (Kaluuya's dealings with cops), terrifying realizations, hilarious satire and even some Django-esque wish-fulfilment, Get Out is as refreshingly thoughtful as it is enveloping. Chris (Kaluuya) , a young black photographer, is going on a trip with his white girlfriend (Williams) to meet her parents (Keener, Whitford). As the weekend unfolds, Chris becomes increasingly concerned about the intentions and history of his hosts. Kaluuya is great, leading with empathetic concerned but always present, and he's supported by some truly amazing actors and characters. Brilliantly written and executed, all confusions & questions are answered without being exposited. What's really fascinating though is this is the type of twist-inclined horror that Shyamalan (Sixth Sense) would drool over. However, the reveal is barely the point. Instead the focus is on straight-up weirdness in visuals and ideas that slow-burn from a calmly paced suspense drama into a raucous and insane mind-trip. It's such a confident debut for Peele in the director's seat: the editing and storytelling are clear, the visuals are striking but not obnoxious, the music is ominously perfect. He's clearly studied the masters (Lynch, Cronenberg, Hitchcock) and learned to allow his audience to be perplexed by while simultaneously sucking us right in. With this and Split, it's already looking to be a great year for horror."
763,"8/10 | Get Out is an extremely fun film with some very scary parts, a great plot, fantastic humor, amazing acting and visual effects, with some fantastic music and it is just an overall fun movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is sick of generic horror movies that are predictable and boring, like me.

765,"8/10 | Usually when a movie is very hyped there's a chance it disappoints you, but that's not the case with Get Out. Everyone's been talking about how brilliant Jordan Peele is, and I have to agree.

The very first thing I have to say is I can't believe Get Out is Jordan Peele's directorial debut. The film show such profound understanding of cinema, that many directors don't grasp even though they've done more films than Peele. Also Peele's done some very thorough work. I saw this movie last night and I'm only know writing this review, but during this time I've procrastinated I've re- realised so many moments and details of this movie. They weren't details that made no sense, they were details that either seemed like just an addition to the story or just the kind of stuff you usually have in this genre. The movie itself was completely amazing, but the more I keep thinking about this, the more I'm convinced Jordan Peele is a god damn genius.

All the ingredients of an amazing film are here. The pacing is amazing, so is the build up. The story is detailed, characters carefully planned and multi-dimensional. The soundtrack is incredible and haunting, and it definitely helps to keep you on the edge of your seat.

Get Out also has everything you need from the horror genre. The way the story and the horror progress is amazing and close to perfection. It's just unnerving, then turns into something really disturbing, then turns into absolutely terrifying. All the good elements are there: psychological horror, mind control (or hypnotism) and blood. Also they have manage to keep the audience absolutely excited during the whole thing.

Some of the white audience have been angry at the racism aspect though. But it shouldn't be hard to understand why the white people in this movie are so terrifying.

Get Out is absolutely brilliant movie, and without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen."
766,"8/10 | Potential spoiler alert

I will start by saying that the lead was excellent. However my daughter and I left the film feeling decidedly 'meh'!

After the hype we were expecting a cracking and different horror or at least a good psychological thriller, but, other than a few shock moments at the start, the film just did not follow through.

It felt very derivative, particularly the Stepford Wives/sinister community motif used for the majority of the film. And the 'explanation ' was somewhat rushed.

Sad to be less than enthused but it did not tick any boxes for me.

This was neither a good horror, nor a clever psychological thriller and I'm not sure where the hype originated from. A waste of a good cast!"
767,"3/10 | ""Get Out"" is one of the best movies I have seen in years. I see many movies and I go to be entertained. ""Get Out"" was a great blend of humor, thrills, twisted plots, and a few hidden meanings. Don't let the trailer full you, it isn't too scary. Just an occasional eerie moment, but no monsters.

I was pleasantly surprised at how this movie was put together. Sorry, I am not a educated person at seeing qualities and genius in films beyond what appears on the screen. Just know this movie is worth the ticket price. Some of the reviews I read before attending the movie made political references to the story, but they were making more of it that they should have.

Realistically, I don't think I have seen a film like this before.

769,"9/10 | Jordan Peele has a future as a writer -director. So expertly does he navigate genres in Get Out that I'm struggling to come up with one descriptor; rather I want to put them all in a stew and hyphenate: horror-comedy-social commentary-psychological thriller.

Young black man, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), goes for weekend with white girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams) to her parents' home way out in the woods. The scary tropes are all there including strange servants and wacky psychologist mom (Katherine Keener), all overseen by equally off-center neurosurgeon dad.

If you mash up Guess Who's Coming to dinner with Stepford Wives and add a dash of Freddy for scary laughs, then you'll understand my enthusiasm for this first effort by an entertainer now firmly right behind Damien Chazelle for young, promising filmmakers.

Enjoy brains tossed in a trash bucket and wildly-inappropriate social comments (comments that at the same time as the humor allow Peele to draw on the absurdities of contemporary correctness and social engineering). No social hot button about the place of minorities is not pushed, albeit superficially, but in depth for a horror film.

Now I know why I was so disappointed in the recent Split directed by M. Night Shyamalan: His horror flick was aiming for the expected twist without finesse and understatement. Get Out is assuredly aiming at the incendiary interracial flash point while it attends to issues of conformity and mind control in contemporary society.

This film, however, never loses its sense of humor when it regularly lards the narrative with cell phone conversations between Chris and his shlubby buddy, Rod (LilRel Howlery). It's hilarious use of ethnic humor to advance the plot and provide comic relief from the considerably-scary goings-on. I haven't laughed as heartily as this in a long time.

As amused as I was with Peele's virtuosity, I was perplexed that such a fine genre buffet as this should be released at dumping-ground movie-release time. Surprisingly as well, I have not been as vicariously scared in a long time, perhaps because, stripped of its horror and humor, Get Out is also about us all with our private prejudices fueled by our need to control others when we can't control ourselves.

Enjoy this rich amalgam of light-hearted hokum and genre mixing--or enjoy excellent filmmaking."

771,"6/10 | I think the biggest surprise of this film is just how deeply it really digs into the social commentary that is at its core. That drives the film's themes and it's what makes the genre thrills and horror work. The biggest thing that stood out to me was the absolutely fantastic ensemble cast. The film needs a certain type of acting in its first two acts in order to give enough suspense and enough detail as to what it's about, and the actors have a very clear idea of what the tone needs to be. They're pitch perfect in their work. The film is also very well directed and paced, and it's a total blast to sit through it with a large group of people. Definitely recommended.

772,"8/10 | OVERVIEW: Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is invited by his girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to spend the weekend at her parents estate. This will be the first time Chris has met them and is nervous how their interracial relationship will be received. Something Rose has not warned her parents of. When they first arrive, Chris takes note that both the maid and groundskeeper for the family are black. However, Rose's father Dean (Bradley Whitford) assures him that there are no racial motivations. Even more odd is her mother Missy (Catherine Keener) who practices hypnosis. Despite Chris' decline for a session, she performs it on him anyways.

As the weekend gets underway, the family hosts their yearly party with friends, all of whom are white. Chris is growing uncomfortable as it seems everyone is trying way to hard to seem like they aren't racist. They bring up liking Barack Obama, Tiger woods and even make remarks about his physique. He is surprised to see one black man and attempts to chat with him to ease the awkwardness, but finds the young man to be just as odd as the rest of them. Chris finds comfort in a phone call with his cousin Rod (Lil Rel Howery), who swears something sinister is going on. Both he and his cousin continue to grow in their paranoia as they piece together the strange happenings.

THOUGHTS: For this horror film, the scares are subtle tricks played upon the audience. It follows more of a psychological thriller pattern, avoiding unnecessary jump scares or relying on gore to aid its story. There is an unease that follows you throughout the film as you try to dissect each character and what is truly going on. It's full of tension and continually plays with your mind. There is also a wonderfully unsettling visual representation of hypnosis that this film utilizes for when Chris is incapacitated. It was reminiscent of The Twilight Zone and it was an interesting way to show the helplessness one could feel.

Not surprising was the amount of great comedic moments in this film. There were much needed moments of levity throughout, most delivered by Lil Rel Howery. Use of humor were at times when it felt natural and it wasn't an attempt to overpower the film or its message. Jordan Peele has found so much success in comedy, which was why so many were shocked to hear he was directing and writing this film. This was a nice way for him to merge his love of horror with what he is best known for.

Also worth its own praise is the amazing performance by Daniel Kaluuya. Many will recognize him from his appearance in the Black Mirror episode ""Fifteen Million Merits"". His portrayal of the emotionally scarred Chris was such a well-developed character in a genre that sometimes forgets how to do that.

Tackling racial issues in a horror movie seemed to unnerve some people when the trailer initially dropped. It was easy for people to judge it on the surface, especially for a topic that makes some people uncomfortable. Without getting into spoiler territory, not only is the subject of racism addressed, but also the idea of genetically superiority as well as life. The film is not so easy to dissect and is really a fun one to watch."
773,"5/10 | ""...I take devilish glee in making people uncomfortable"" - Jordan Peele

Sir, you succeed. No room for sugar coating, as Jordan Peele did not do so in the slightest in 'Get Out'. This film may be one of my favorite films in the past decade and maybe ever. Again, one of my favorites, not all time favorite, calm down. This film was so brilliantly done from performance, to story, to the meaning behind it all, to the twists, just everything. I think what I truly loved about all of this is the originality behind it all. Jordan Peele wrote this and directed this. As it may have a few nods to past films (which, c'mon, what film does not take or at least nod to a past film?), it ultimately left me so satisfied to witness such a creative horror/thriller... Another thing this film did so brilliantly was keeping the audience curious until the very end. Although some things could be predicted, I personally still sat there thinking ""what in the f*$# is going on, what are these people doing?"". It is almost as if Jordan took his dark comedic skits from ""Key & Peele"" and eliminated the comedy and let the dark vibe of it run wild... Lastly, the performances. Applause all around to everyone involved. I hope to see some of these actors and actresses in more projects in the future. I received a very strong Robin Lord Taylor (Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin in 'Gotham') vibe out of Caleb Landry Jones and could foresee him taking on more villainous roles in the future. Betty Gabriel has been a favorite of mine with her involvement in ""The Purge"" films and seeing her involvement and performance in this film just reinforced that favoritism ten-fold. Daniel Kaluuya is a star-in-the-making, absolutely loved him in his main role. Last but not least, LilRel Howery stole the show. No matter how dark 'Get Out' got, LilRel's scenes are when the film takes a breath in the form of laugh-out-loud comedy. Brilliant performances all around.

I had majorly high expectations for this film since I first saw a trailer for it and impressively they were exceeded. A horror flick from the mind of Jordan Peele. See this, folks, it is a good one.

774,"8/10 | I wish more horror films were as relevant and smart as Get Out. The movie feeds off a paranoia that the majority of the United States population doesn't experience on a regular basis. Fake smiles and awkward handling of racially charged conversations are masterfully put on display in the first half of the movie. The cracks in the white facade intensify at a steady pace. Uncomfortable questions or points start popping up in the viewer's mind. What is up with the eclectic decor (explicitly called out)? Why are all the black ""caretakers"" acting ""white"" on the property? Are we, as white people, really this ignorant? In short, you start to feel an entire system is out to get our protagonist. Admittedly, an early scene explicitly sets the stage up. Mainstream horror films play it safe with the usual jump scares and gory imagery. To be sure, Get Out sports a fair amount of both elements. At some point, all too shockingly familiar racism starts to out scare the traditional horror clichés. Unfortunately, several dumb horror tropes also make an appearance. For example, you have that one horror scene where you have an odd figure chopping wood. The others tropes I could list involve spoilers. The acting is consistently top notch from all involved. I only have one minor quip with the casting choice of a peripheral character. The character certainly sticks out when you notice him and the inclusion is somewhat puzzling. Overall, the subject matter more than makes up for Get Out's very minor shortcomings. How often do movies aimed at a mainstream audience have the audacity to call out whites in America? The timing of the film's release is sadly impeccable. Racism is alive and well in our country. America ""smiled"" when she elected Trump as POTUS. I congratulate Jordan Peele for his impressive foray into directing. The film is dense and I certainly missed a few points on my first viewing."
775,"9/10 | If you''ve ever been to a carnival and eaten a bad turkey leg, 2 or 3 hours later would have most certainly found you locked in the bathroom paying the price for having done so, miserably clutching your guts, shaking your head and swearing to never go to another carnival again, or if you did, at the very least, not to ever go near that particular type of food again. Such is the case here. Go to the theater, by all means, do. There are many good choices to see out there. But 'Get Out' is the 'bad turkey leg' here. Undigestable, poisonous, foul-smelling...a heaping plate of malignant racism disguised as something for your senses to savor. No. This particular turkey belongs In the latrine pit.

776,"8/10 | I totally disliked this at first. It starts off like an updated version of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"", with a young, stereotypical white woman from an upper class family trying to prove her liberal, anti-racist bona fides by bringing her black boyfriend home to meet her family. But then things start getting interesting, as Chris (the African-American hero) begins running into increasingly disturbing situations. There is the faux-hearty banter with the family, with its racial overtones. And then there is the matter of the strange behavior of the family's black employees. Get Out is fresh, disconcerting, and often funny. Racial tension between white and black Americans is clearly the subject, but things never get preachy. I was not crazy about the ending, which veers into horror/cult movie territory, but this is a unique and fascinating film.

Although the movie wasn't really ""scary"" it was definitely unsettling, a nice addition to the horror/thriller genre that seems to get worse and worse. Being a horror movie fan, this movie was a pleasant change from most of the recent films I've seen in this genre and I highly recommend it.

780,"2/10 | A measured and endearing enough beginning as a couple proceed to 'meet the parents'. The fact that she is white, the family wealthy and he is black shouldn't make any difference. Should it? He is aprehensive and we understand and to some extent share his concerns, especially as she seems not to have any similar concerns. This is where we are already sensing something is wrong but when things turn 'weird' at the house we rather relax into the notion that this is going to be a horror story, maybe based on the guy's paranoia. Well, this goes way beyond that into 'Society' and 'Stepford Wives' territory, but always with an element of race. This becomes more and more pronounced until the film is about little else and the audience is set up to cheer the death count (of the white folk). Allison Williams is a real discovery and will surely go o to greater things and the director too clearly has skills but that chip on his shoulder and a liking for racial humour may hold him back.

There isn't too much action, the story would need a good remake, but overall I did enjoy the film. There are some moments when you will get a little bit scared, but that's really just too low to call it a horror film. It does have a couple of good morals though - Never trust anyone, listen to your friends and be ready for anything.

782,"6/10 | I used to watch and enjoy Key and Peele's show because it was always edgy and irreverent, seeming to dodge the stupid tropes everyone else was engaged in. Boy was I wrong. Get Out is so out of touch with reality it is painful. It might have been relevant in the 1950's, but for some reason the left has sought to resurrect the idea that white people are still evil slave owners seeking to chain all blacks and get back to the good ol' slavery days. This concept is so cringeworthy that I kept thinking that aliens kidnapped Mr. Peele and replaced him with a knee jerk liberal who ignores the facts in favor of being a terminal victim. Of course right off the bat the stupid girlfriend has to get sassy with a cop for no reason other than we're supposed to think the cop hates her black boyfriend and wants to give him a hard time. Lol really? One of the worst and most disingenuous films I've seen in a long time.

783,"8/10 | I came into this movie expecting something to be pounding racism as the main theme. I expected it to just be about racism and how certain groups of people want to go back to the days of slavery. It didn't hit racism in a way that was meant to make people feel uncomfortable. The remarks about racism are more common themes and not the point of the movie. I don't Want to spoil the movie, as the overall plot is interesting. Just this movie being primarily about racism would likely keep many away from it. It does have themes involving racism, but that is not the primary objective of the movie as far as I can see.

The movie has a slow build, but really picks up around an hour in. The build feels justified at the end. There's a particularly comical character that is scene more and more as the movie goes and steals the show towards the end. The plot twist is particularly interesting as it's not quite what was expected and yet seems like a reasonable twist.

Not a fantastic movie, but overall a fun movie going experience. Not excessively gory to prevent people who don't enjoy those parts in movies, but it is R for a reason. Just seems like a good balance that really surprised me that I didn't regret seeing it."

789,"1/10 | Captivating, spellbinding and well directed - these are not the adjectives generally associated with American horror movies. It is a genre which is now suffocating under the sheer volume of silliness produced every year. A genre, so muddled by clichés, that it is not worth watching even for casual entertainment. And that is why Get Out stays as an genre defying exception. The debut feature by Jonathan Peele uses every genre tricks available - but does so cleverly that they become part of the cinematic language and not just thrill seekers' staples.

Get Out works at multiple levels. On the outset it is a horror movie. It builds up the suspense masterfully, adds a well anticipated twist and ends with just the right amount of gore. But then in the narrative it becomes a social critique. There are moments when it becomes psychological thriller and makes you really uncomfortable. At times it pays homage to genre stalwarts like The Clockwork Orange but the very next moment it takes a turn towards a socio-political satire. And it does all of these with such an agility that the audience never loses the connection with the proceedings. There is a hero to sympathize with - but the other characters are masterfully played. The movie hints towards an underlying psychology of hatred which is very relevant in today's world.

Get out is an absolutely recommended watch for the movie lovers. Such a genre defying movie is very hard to come by."
790,"10/10 | When Donald Trump asked blacks during the campaign, 'What do you have to lose?' he didn't exactly have in mind the circumstances envisioned in Jordan Peele's highly original breakout film Get Out. If you think that the story of a white girl bringing her young black boyfriend home to meet her parents in an idyllic rural setting is going to be a romantic comedy, think again. Influenced by such horror films as Rosemary's Baby and Stepford Wives, Get Out has some romance in it and some comedy but they are all wrapped in a twilight zone basket of social satire, horror, and science fiction that adds up to a roller-coaster ride of dizzying proportions.

Peele, a former comedy star whose show Key and Peele was an Emmy Award-winning series on Comedy Central, has said that he would consider his film to be a ""social thriller,"" a genre he describes as one in which ""the horror is embedded in the way people interact, the way people think, the way people categorize."" More directly, he has fashioned a look at the unconscious racism that may lie beneath the outward appearance of polite society. The film opens with a black man (Lakeith Stanfield) walking alone on a suburban street in a white neighborhood who is assaulted and thrown into the trunk of a car by a masked assailant, a reminder of the recent murder of Trayvon Martin.

The scene then shifts to New York where Chris Washington, a young African-American photographer superbly performed by British actor Daniel Kaluuya, is planning to travel with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to upstate New York to meet Rose's parents. Though Rose admits that she has not told her parents that Chris is black, she reassures him that they are open-minded and supporters of President Barack Obama who would vote again for him if he could run. Chris and Rose have terrific chemistry together and appear to be on the same wavelength in their outlook on life.

Their trip proceeds without incident until it is interrupted when they hit a deer crossing the road and have an encounter with a police. In what looks like racial profiling, the officer asks to see Chris' ID even though he wasn't the driver but Rose forcefully intervenes in his behalf, a shadowy portent of later events. Chris feels welcome in the home of Rose's parents, bearded physician Dean (Bradley Whitford) and psychiatrist and hypnotist Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener) who both say the right things even though somewhat awkwardly. Dean tells Chris about his father losing an Olympic qualifying race to Jesse Owens and Missy invites Chris to let her cure his smoking habit with hypnotism but he senses that all is not right.

His antennas go up further when Rose's brother, a martial arts enthusiast (Caleb Landry Jones), returns home and immediately challenges Chris to a jujitsu contest. Things take an even more strange turn when he encounters the Armitage's zombie-like black groundskeeper, Walter (Marcus Henderson), and housekeeper Georgina (Betty Gabriel). When elderly friends of the grandparents arrive at the Armitage's for an afternoon garden party, all white except for an older Japanese man and a younger black man (Stanfield), Chris is taken aback by embarrassing comments about Chris' physique and sexual powers and the only black guest suddenly becomes aggressive and threatening.

Feeling stressed by the unfolding situation, Chris calls his best friend Rod (LilRel Howery), a TSA officer who offers some needed humor but also has an unerring insight into what is taking place at the Armitages. The reveal in the last part of the film is too delicious to give away but it is recommended that you fasten your seat belts for a wild ride. Get Out is a highly entertaining thriller that will keep you enthralled right up until the last minute. While it does have some social implications that is up to each viewer to sort out, according to Peele, ""the film isn't meant to alienate white viewers so much as let them see this experience that we've (black people) been living through."" Although perhaps the rich white liberals in the film are an easy target and depicted as caricatures, Peele says that he ""wanted the movie to reflect the racism that exists in all of us."" This reflection is also a mirror of the fears that exist in the hearts of black people who must carefully navigate the racial divide every single day of their lives."

792,"1/10 | The first thing that stands out about Get Out is its direction. Jordan Peele is the true break-out star of this film. He brings an ingenuity and a grace to his direction, giving us a very well- rounded movie. We have fantastic moments of horror, which were terrifying. We have brilliant moments of comedy, which were hysterical. We have excellent moments of political commentary, which were thought-provoking. Peele is able to pack so much into one film, and is able to balance it all with perfectly measured ratios, as if he's been doing this for years. Not every director could go from a moment of pure horror to a moment of pure comedy in a second, and Peele is able to do this without it feeling forced. He was also able to build incredible tension and atmosphere, which is not something a lot of horror movies do these days. They just go from jump scare to jump scare, but Peele was able to craft this incredibly tense atmosphere that allowed the elements of horror to breathe naturally...

793,"6/10 | I won't go into the details of the film, because there is no need to once you know the premise. The premise is: Whitey evil, black man best.

All the black characters are solely filled with positive attributes, all the white characters are nothing but negatives. If the roles were reversed, there'd be a huge outcry, but of course in this day and age, noone would dare to make such a movie.

""Get Out"" is just the latest of a long, long line of anti-white movies, enjoyed by the regressive left, celebrated by so-called critics who'd not dare to speak poorly of this movie, and hyped by the plethora of anti-white POC.

The thing is: I bet that with every movie like this, there will be more (white) people waking up to what the media is doing, more people will see the blatant double standards, more people will get sick of the ruling narrative. The pendulum will inevitebly swing back. Do you really want to fuel a race war? Because with an endless tsunami of racist stuff like this, a race war is exactly what you'll fuel. I am sick of it

The story, if it wasn't for the travesty described above, would've been ok, albeit nothing special."
794,"10/10 | This movie is obviously meant to be racist against white people tomake them feel bad about themselves and hug a 'brother' or something. But it also promotes interracial relationships so it kinda says: not all white people are racist, just 99%

It has this fantastic undercurrent running though the film, a tension that you can't ignore. You know things are messed up, you just don't know how exactly. Brilliant fun :)

810,"9/10 | I feel like this movie should be classified as a mystery/comedy, rather than horror. That's how I'm rating this film. If I were to rate this based on how scary it is, it would be much lower.

The premise and social commentary are quite interesting, and hilarious at times. The movie is just interesting enough to keep me engaged in the film. Although nothing stood out at as particularly great. For such a highly acclaimed film though, some of the films special effects look hilariously amateurish, like something a college film student would put together. It doesn't really hurt the film all that much. It's just funny to see from a Hollywood film. Maybe some of those amateur effects are intentional.

814,"9/10 | Hope this politically correct age passes by soon and people and critics start again appreciating art for the art sake. This B movie does not even deserve a review. Shame on all the ""critics"" that brought this mediocrity to the Oscars. If you don't believe what I say go to the theater or buy it and waste your money and your time. I can not remember a single scene of this garbage that is not overacted, dull or ridiculous. If you want to see black people acting for the sake of politically correctness there are plenty of movies out there that you can enjoy. You want to see great black actors, go watch every Morgan Freeman, Denzel Washington or Samuel Jackson film, just to name a few, or go watch Black Panther, which is a decent piece of entertainment, not this forgettable thing called Get Out.

Shame on Hollywood for destroying aesthetical values one more time for the sake of politics.

815,"9/10 | Sorry, but all this obsession with racism in every corner is not prototype nor something viewers enjoy. Rather using stereotypes and clichés and being racist against specific people who you consider not too progressive, not too open, not too identical to the mainstream. So the obsession of anti-racism turns out to be racism itself. Making specific minorities to feel more angry for any past disputes and targeting specific groups of people by those minorities and by many more. The movie tries so hard to point out this issue, that in every corner you see or hear stereotype racist comments, concerns, bad behavior always coming from the whites. So in the end the movie succeeds just the opposite. To make people deal and feel either bad or angry with one another. Not a good movie. Too bad, because this concept could have been used differently succeeding in a much better result, without insulting anyone and being more realistic.. Not recommended!

817,"9/10 | Sick movie, Sick sound track. The music contradicts the circumstances in the early scenes perfectly. Everything seems cool, but you as the audience know there is something fishy going on. You can't put your finger on it just yet and neither can the protagonist, you feel his frustration building as he fails to explain the incongruencies to his girlfriend. He wants to ""get out"", but he has to go through this if he wants the relationship to progress. The internal struggle is real, and when sh*t gets too real (when more knowledge comes to light) it's too late for our friendly protagonist.

The way he gets sunk in (sunken) to all the non sense is pretty original, the scene that visualised what was going on in the characters mind was excellent, as he falls deeper and deeper and his vision of reality slips away. On the edge of your seat the whole way. The acting is excellent from all members of the cast. The movie fulfils its thriller genre, but also delivers some 10 out of 10 comedy moments. All in all, Sick movie, 10 stars, would watch again.

The title in the end credits was also nice touch"
818,"9/10 | Everything good that you've read about this movie is wrong. This is true what Armond White of National Reviw said - this is a shallow rendition of serious racial slur topic on to a Tarantino-type idiocy with all its worst traits, and a deeper delving into a very sleazy and outwardly silly moss of dullness, tedium, drag, plod, endless F-words, endless slow pacing and very midget message, which all was lost in mire and drabness and woven with webs of tepid boredom. Avood this awful flick at all costs, and believe me - hatdly ever had I seen a more shallow and skinted wry fest of weak rants and totally blank shooting with zero results.

821,"7/10 | Jordan Peele crushed his debut. I saw this film with 5 people and not a single one of us ""disliked"" it. 7's or better across the board.

This movie was a fun, little nightmare. I only assume that this is a reoccurring nightmare for Mr. Peele, which is both hilarious and terrifying.

A very unconventional, satirical horror gem. You will laugh. But, the jokes are so subtle that the laughter does not distract from your terror and curiosity of ""what the hell is going on, here?!""

8/10 - Loved it!

823,"3/10 | The first-time director is an African American actor, comedian, film director, and screenwriter, formerly of the Comedy Central show Key & Peele. One reviewer says this will be ""the boldest - and most important - studio genre release of the year."" The horrible rich white family out in the country focuses its malevolent attention exclusively on black men. Their daughter brings her black boyfriend to meet them for the weekend. It's a Brit who plays the boyfriend, Chris Washington, Daniel Kaluuya. You identify with him throughout. As his TSA employee best friend Rod, comic LilRel Howery breaks the tension nicely by providing humor. Some say the play with racial ideas is more a focus than the horror, and it's not horrible enough. It's just a broad and simple horror movie - seeing the poster for Gore Verbinski's A Cure for Wellness on the way out reminded me how much more complex and visually rich that is. Nonetheless I was shattered when it was over. This is a movie that skillfully ramps up feelings and concerns about race we already have or would have. Metacritic rating 83%. Watched at Regal Union Square on its opening day 24 Feb."
824,"10/10 | I was hoping to see a thriller, at least. It is not a real horror, neither satire. Not even close.

The director beats around the bush, although the whole story could be packed in a shortcut. He was so carried away by the theme of racism that he forgot about directing and screenwriting as such.

The idea is not bad, but everything that went beyond the scope of the synopsis, not worthy of so much attention. And it has 4 nominations!? Such a reaction to the film from the public is very similar to the way guests reacted to Chris at the Armitage's party. It is a badly acted lie.

Expertly directed and written whilst following a fairly easy to predict plot that does tip over into the the old ultraviolence in the last act but overall i dont feel it suffered too badly for this.

Performances all round are very good and it has a good blend of unsettling sinister goings on with some humour in there too which is not an easy thing to pull off.

Very enjoyable stuff.

Witing's not strong enough to support strong acting even though it has top-notch talents like Steven Root & Catherine Keener in it. Follows all the tropes of horror movies going back to the silents but if it wasn't for the reverse-racism slant, it would be a low-budget straight to video film.

828,"8/10 | Directed by Jordan Peele. Starring Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, Caleb Landry Jones, Lil Rel Howery, Lakeith Stanfield, Stephen Root, Betty Gabriel, Erika Alexander, Marcus Henderson. (R)

Writer/director Peele's satirical horror film is incisive, thoughtful, provocative, discomforting, flat-out entertaining; one of the best feature film debuts in years. Story follows young black man Kaluuya, traveling with his white girlfriend (Williams) to meet her folks, but something is definitely off with not just her family, but the entire situation. A near-perfect balance between that which arrests and that which unsettles, keeping the audience fully invested in what's happening (primarily through humor, character development, and the turning of the plot screws) while also putting them on edge and squirming in their seats. Even if one goes into the film completely cold, there aren't too many surprise revelations, and the build-up is better than the payoff, but it's that rare instance of a movie based around twists and suspense and toying with audience expectations that actually improves on the revisit; plenty to think about and unpeel and study at different angles, details and asides that can be missed the first time around. Also added ""Sunken Place"" to the modern lexicon, which is always on the lookout for the latest buzzword to mishandle and dilute.

I can now safely say that this is probably one of the best horror film of this era.

834,"7/10 | I'm not comparing this to an action movie that had a tag line you might be reminded of. The tag line seems to be fitting though. And while this can be considered both a comedy and drama, it has issues in it, that might be tough to swallow for some. There is a reason why some thought this was racist ... towards white people.

Yes I had to laugh about that too! Putting silliness aside, because this can also be considered as dead serious horror. But also as relevant socially speaking. And entertaining. So while the movie delivers stereotypes and plays with them, it also shows things that are lying there - some are in the open others are more hidden. Still racism and discrimination is a thing - why not have ""fun"" depicting it and hopefully learn something from it?

835,"9/10 | I never thought I would watch a horror film all the way through, never mind watch it twice. At first it seems like an updated version of ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" with all the awkward moments of the 60's films. That's why the significance of much of what happens at the start of the film needs a second viewing to appreciate. With this many reviews already on IMDB, I won't repeat what these are. Trust me on this one. Get Out isn't boring, nothing is really as it appears and the violent ending will actually make you feel happy about the way things turn out.

The only reason that Get Out didn't win the Best Film at the Academy Awards is because it's different, original. After all, it made me do things I never thought I would do.

836,"8/10 | 'Get Out' is what you shout at a character in a horror movie who's doing everything but what a sensible human being would do - looking in the basement, getting into the car, going to bed with the vampire. Don't go there! Get out!

Chris Washington (Afro-English Daniel Kaluuya) is an African-American photographer with an old-money white girlfriend (Allison Williams) who goes to her (weird) parents' country place for the weekend. Get out, says his buddy (LilRel Howery) over the phone, who's minding his dog. But Chris can't. Or can he? Should he? What's wrong with all the black people in this house? It's all good. Until it isn't.

The great thing about Get Out is that it creates its own logical universe and sticks to it. There's a reason for everything that happens, including how all the characters react, and it all makes sense within the movie. It's also refreshing, knowing and funny in its treatment of the Guess Who's Coming To Dinner angle, with a lot of er, black humour.

My fave is where the buddy goes to the cops to explain that Chris has been missing for 2 days. I won't spoil the joke.

As well as good jokes, there are excellent shock and suspense moments too; it's a well-paced, quality movie and there's some class acting turns. It puts a modern racial angle on a pretty traditional horror scenario, but It does this very well indeed.

Ultimately it's an old-school thriller with a social twist; and the gore and violence levels pitched perfectly. Enough to make you cringe, but not to make you retch, Also includes things to think about and things to laugh at."
837,"8/10 | The first time I viewed the movie, I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, viewing it the again, I found myself picking up on subtle details (""aha"" moments) that come only after seeing the entire movie before. It is well worth the time of a second viewing.

839,"8/10 | While the premise is quality and the on-screen chemistry between Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams was great - the movie fell a bit flat for me. The writing could have gone in a number of different creative directions and the final script was not the best choice.

I left the movie without feeling the overall scope of the difficulty with inter racial dating in the United States. Which could have been a terrific arc, especially with the political leanings of Rose's (Allison Williams) father. Instead the movie turned into a basic thriller afterwards.

The overall acting was good, the music was fine, and there weren't any major editing flaws. However, I was expecting far more from this film.

Overall Score: 6.2

846,"8/10 | I'll admit that I'm not a fan of horror films. The fact that Get Out (2017) was released in that weird, ""horror month"" of February that merely exists so people trying to catch up on their Oscar nominations don't have to watch anything new meant that it mostly passed under my radar. When buzz about the movie continued for the rest of the year, I was still skeptical as horror has been known for its cheap tricks and gratuitous violence, both of which I don't particularly care for. The trick is, Get Out is certainly a horror film, but with the minimum required trappings to be considered one.

With a few jump scares and a violent and bloody ending, Get Out works on a level that's best described as ""blatantly subtle."" It's not so much that it screams about the racial differences between black people and white people, but that it does so in a way that's almost natural and unnoticed. So much of the movie highlights some of the weird and eye-rolling habits and likes of white people that you'd likely miss them if you blinked. Of course, this highlights the terror of the premise, but the comedy in this film helps to break up these moments with some levity to give the audience a break.

Even though I was aware of the premise and some of the major plot points before watching Get Out, I was still surprised by how everything connected. The strength of the plot is held together by a number of parallel themes and motifs that give the audience credit for paying attention and seeing how they interweave with the characters' past and motivations. People have praised neophyte director Jordan Peele for this piece of work, but I think he just saw the formula for this type of movie, distilled it down to its fundamental elements, and made it something all his own.

A smart, thrilling, and poignant film breaking through the ""same old business"" in Hollywood, I give Get Out 5.0 stars out of 5."
847,9/10 | 
848,"9/10 | It is a good film, but I'm not sure why people love it the way they do. Like it is a social justice thing or something. I've heard everything from conspiracy theories about body organ harvesting to warnings about interracial relationships and nothing appears to come close to a true understanding about what the film does, and that is merely to provide metaphors for deeper issues about race. What those are, is totally up to you to decide. What disturbs me, is that people want to take the film literally, and the absurdity of what we see in this film suggests, at least to me, that the film was never meant to be taken literally.

I almost wonder if people are actually watching the sketches from Key and Peele and enjoying them for the social commentary or if that aspect goes completely over their head. The fact that we're looking deeper into anything they do or try to figure things out suggests that the joke is on us. If anything I love the film because it successfully trolls people looking for something to validate whatever theories or micro aggression they may have. It is not a question of whether the film is the truth about anything so much as it is a consideration about why we're looking under pillows and mattresses for confirmation about the complexities of race relations that we already know too well.

Watch the film. Yes, things are not always as they seem. But that isn't the point. The point of it is that you want things to be what they are not. But what are you going to do about it once you come into the realization of what it truly is, and who is to say that you'll never do it all over again?"
849,"9/10 | I wanted to love this. The earliest reviews alluded to certain subtleties of dialogue that would make me both laugh and twinge. Instead I found the film dull, lifeless. The fact that the main characters are political liberals tends to serve no real end. I was hoping that liberal values would pervade the film and slowly ever so slowly lead he main characters down a deadly path. But no. The strangeness of the characters is a dead giveaway early on and the willingness of the hero to subject himself to their whims seems altogether false. Without giving anything away there are two shocking moments in the film at which time the audience (a) gasps and (b) applauded. I must admit that I did join them.

851,"9/10 | This movies movies slow at points and you can see what's going to happen before it does but it keeps enough secrets that you're never fully sure how it will end till it does. It deserves credit for creating tension and holding it well. At first glance there appears to be a racist motivation in the antagonists' actions but there is evidence that would suggest it's much more simple. There are a couple lines and actions that would indicate the primary motivator behind the actions of the villains is the oldest sin: pride. They are proud of who they are but wish to be better, going with a narcissistic philosophy of it doesn't matter who gets hurt if it benefits them personally. There are multiple interracial relationships and no way to truly know how real or fake any of them were. The one person involved in such a relationship at one point appears to have real feelings for their partner of a different race and at another point seems to be a text book psychopath incapable of having any sort of compassion, empathy, sorrow or the such for anyone but themselves and they will hurt anyone in anyway if it will benefit them.

Rather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing. 4/5 🌟

Within the runtime of 1hour 45mins you'll definitely get the feeling which we call thrill. Jordan Peele's directorial debut has hit the bulls eye the man has got some direction skills, not to forget he is also the writer of this movie. Tight and brilliantly written screenplay with smart and crisp direction blended with some notable performance by Daniel Kaluuya is what that makes it a terrifying and a spectacular ride.

860,"7/10 | This movie was nominated to best picture of the oscar in the 2017 edition, but why ?, i really wouldnt know, could be because of the controversy of 2016, about no black actors been nominated, and really was about lack of diversity in the nominations. Maybe this movie is just a scape goat. So the movie..., very interisting plot, so much that they could have done with that i think, but this plot in the middle of the movie gets totally smashed by the comercial thriller wagon. Some of the scene were very well done, but most of them (the goodies) were the comic parts, or the conspiration ones, the rest of the movie feels very flat. Acting its not the best in my opinion (although in movies like this is probably not the most importat), keener was a delight though. In summary great start, but ends like a mission imposible sort of film.

861,"7/10 | I'll keep it short. This film has lots of surprises with some great acting and it'll make you think (well, it should do). The ending perhaps (and it is only a perhaps) could've been stronger, but it was in no way a let down. Not really a horror movie imo. A chiller for sure. This film is creepy but brilliant and well worth a watch.

862,"1/10 | Get Out is one of the best horror movies of this century. The dialogue and events that occur are all so relatable and engaging, and it's all highlighted my some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. I cannot properly express how impressed I am by the entire cast, and the psychological aspects were incredible! This is an art piece. Just because horror and comedy don't get labelled as art very often doesn't mean it isn't possible.

864,"4/10 | The ultimate in thriller escapism. The director skillfully reverses the conventional plot and then reverses it into a New Year's Day family comedy. It was hilarious, it was applause, it was boom, it was a big party. It's well made on a shoestring, and the director knows what the audience wants and knows how to make a commercial film.

To understand the whole movie I watched it 3 times to find out about every hidden thing in this movie. Would definetly recommend.

866,"7/10 | In GET OUT, Director Jordan Peele has created a gripping horror film that is also a biting social satire. When a man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) accompanies his girlfriend (Allison Williams) on a weekend trip to meet her parents, an awkward situation slowly turns into an unspeakable nightmare. Kaluuya plays Chris as a man tormented by a past event, which he must overcome if he is to survive. Instilled w/ a general sense of uneasiness, and some genuinely disturbing / disorienting moments, the movie builds toward its terrifying conclusion. A wicked sense of humor is also evident throughout the story. Original and effective...

867,"6/10 | I don't think the movie is as great as the ratings show. But it is still pretty original and entertaining. I just feel it wasn't developed enough and a lot could have been done better. I think the acting was really good. And it did a great job developing the paranoia in the beginning, it just went downhill when we were supposed to find out what happened.

I don't think the movie is ""racist"". People whining about it are just as bad as SJWs who see racism everywhere.

It's still entertaining, funny, and just as scary as I like a movie to be. It's not a horror movie, though.

879,"10/10 | I love that a movie released in February is still dominating the conversation when it comes to best movies of the year. The tightrope the movie walks between racism and liberal guilt is impressive, and it makes the more supernatural aspects more believable. Personally, I love the attack on smug attitude of the rich and powerful, as well as I jump for joy as more original stories like this one come to light. The special effects used in the ""sunken place"" are like nothing I have ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood movie. It may not be a perfect movie, but it is perfectly rabid and full of ideas that it is unafraid to throw at the audience, and in a way that is more respectable than being formally perfect. That so many people of all races find something to love about this movie reveals much about America in 2017.....i'm sure there are many essays that could/ will be written about it.

882,"10/10 | No doubt the lead actor Daniel Kaluuya who plays the African American boyfriend named Chris Washington was a stand out and well deserving of his Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Chris who is going to meet his white girlfriend named Rose Armitage's (Allison Williams) parents at their home for the first time doesn't know what to expect on his first overnight stay and neither does the audience.

This film bares little resemblance to the classic 1967 Comedy/Drama Guess Who's Coming to Dinner starring Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn, which also has the African American boyfriend surprising his white girlfriend's parents over dinner at their home. The comparison ends there.

Actor Daniel Kaluuya's facial expressions are priceless and I give him kudos for carrying this films quality performance more than the seasoned actors Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener who play Rose Armitage's parents. I also thought actor Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams as Chris Washington's long distance best friend and advisor was the perfect opposite of the frantic Chris Washington. The screenplay reminded me a bit of the original 1975 The Stepford Wives in the vein of being brainwashed and under someone else's control.

My only disappointment was the ending was a letdown compared to the other 90 percent of a very good screenplay. Overall I give the film a respectable 7 out of 10 rating and it is worth watching."
883,10/10 | 
884,"10/10 | This picture honestly came out of nowhere, because who would expect from Jordan Peele, a man who was knee-deep in comedies and humorous yet of poor taste comedic duos, would write and direct this visionary picture. 'Get out' is by far my most favourite horror film, a classy film that does not rely on cheesy jump scares and completely irrelevant stories, it is a film that raised the bar of great scary movies and transcended to a high artistic level, utilising the power of cinematography, dialogue, soundtrack, symbolism and acting to crate a gem , a movie that sends shivers down one's spine without any kind of conventional scaring technique . First of all, this movie is a directorial triumph, with a scent of classic Tarantinesque vibe and subtle foreshadowing and clever writing, Jordan Peele took Hollywood by storm with his first and original work featuring an ensemble cast of both new commers and more experienced actors. Photographer Chris Washington , portrayed genuinely by Daniel Kaluuya, is an African-American photographer who has an interracial relationship with white wealthy southern girl rose Armitage , depicted by Allison Williams, and is obliged to meet her apparently opened family ,but after experiencing multiple incidents inside the family's residence, it is clear that the Armitage family has other plans for the poor Chris. The great amount of fear and plain confusion that Chris feels during his visit is beautifully screened by the incredible and Oscar worthy performance of Mr.Kaluuya , this added to the intimidating and honestly anguishing performance of Catherine keener added more depth and creepiness to the already shocking reality conveyed by the theme of the movie itself . Another crucial element in the success of the movie is the brilliant use of camera angels: the movies is a collection of perfectly shot and unsettling scenes that gave this movie its originality and granted its success. 'Get out' sets itself apart from its peers, giving more importance to writing, seen in the well-crafted screenplay, and vivid performances of its cast making the audience clench to their seats in both awe and fear. But what made me love this picture so much was how visionary the overall directing was, how much importance was given to the smallest details in the film, to a point in which you will always miss something in the first time you will watch this movie. Another important aspect of this movie was its noble cause, or at least is noble message. The entire movie is an allegory of the racial state of some of America's communities especially towards people of colour, 'Get out' recaps rather brilliantly what has been said multiple times in many significant Hollywood films, but this particular picture meant the most to me because it made itself as a work of art in the process: this mesmerising picture is going to be the best start for a staggering career for the ascending director Jordan Peele."
885,"10/10 | I'd been postponing to watch this movie for a long time. Not having found any interesting movie as I wanted, finally I decided to see if it's a good movie as much as the people say. At first I thought that it was going to have a cerebral scenario but it does have a very straightforward one.

As you now, Daniel Kaluuya was nominated for Oscar, but he didn't get it. I didn't think he would anyway. But I have to admit that, he remarkably acted well. You can feel the emotions and anxiety through his eyes. I'm a bit surprised to see his unexpected performance.

The scenario is Achilles heel, the movie was relatively short and this may be the main cause why you feels so empty when the credits begin to roll. I don't want to give any spoiler but the less expectation you have the more joy you have is how I can summarize the movie."
886,10/10 | 
887,"10/10 | I can kinda see why Get Out received so much praise. It's essentially a Key & Peele sketch with a horror skin. Smart and chilling social satire with fine performances and strong tension building. My personal criticisms: Weak scares, and forgiving action and gore. Too much last-second cutaway nonsense. I can't say it really lives up to the R rating. Definitely an interesting film nonetheless, but I wouldn't put it on my favorites of 2017.

888,"10/10 | I can not understand how this movie was rated so high. Besides the fact of a horrible storyline, it is by far the most racist thing I've ever seen.

In the world we live in where people should feel bad about being born white, they make a movie like this making whites people out to be the racist ones. The critics and fans of this movie are all clearly extreme leftists and it has not been given a fair review.

Don't waste your time watching this racist bs.

889,"10/10 | I don't got to movie theaters often. With Netflix and other online video websites, the need isn't clear for the theater. As soon as I laid eyes on the ""Get Out"" trailer, it was immediately clear why I needed to see this in theater with others. The subject matter was heavy. The acting was precise. The story line was provocative. There was some concern early on that the trailer gives away too much. It does show a lot of crucial moments but there are shocking twists that go way beyond the trailer.

This movie could not be more relevant or necessary in the Trump Presidency in which we find ourselves if for nothing else than to discuss perspectives on race and perception.

10 out of 10 stars.

PS: Jordan Peele directorial debut was a major success.

891,"7/10 | People raved about this movie so much that we were actually really excited to see it (and I love Key & Peele, so I figured it would be creative and well executed.) But to our disappointment, this movie was awful. Overall, it was just really basic and tried to twist old horror themes into something different under the guise of something unique, while being way over-directed, forcing social themes which were largely inorganic to the plot, and presenting several holes in the overall logic of the story that made it hard to ""buy in"" at any point in the movie. I'd really hoped this would be a chilling thriller that would keep me on the edge of my seat, but we were barely able to finish it.

894,"10/10 | This is a slightly better than average horror film. I suspect that overinflated expectation probably doesn't do the film any favours. Hyping it as particularly new or original doesn't feel warranted to me. There are several similarly themed films and certainly several similar feeling films. Maybe it has attracted an audience that wouldn't normally watch this type of film. It is reasonably well-done for what it is. Many of the criticisms I have I would forgive of horror films that carry me along with them. They stand out more with this because it didn't pull me along with it as much as it should. It didn't build tension much at all for me. It didn't really have me rooting for anyone or questioning things. It just didn't grab me very much.

There is a lot of talk of race around this film. Is this a black/white film that divides on those lines? Do I find it racist? If the black/white characters were reversed would it be racist? Is it rebalancing previous racism by turning it on its head? Does it really matter? Are people taking it too seriously? Race is obviously an issue in the film but presumably to prod the audience a bit - it doesn't feel preachy. It is noticeable that ALL the white characters are devious, manipulative and unpleasant but it is a relatively small number of people. Within the world of the film all the white characters are bad - that's OK - it doesn't have to mean all white people are bad unless you want to deliberately generalise beyond what the film does.

Leaving the whole black/white thing to one side - ultimately it is meant to be a horror/thriller (maybe with a bit of old-school sci-fi thrown-in) that is not too serious. Is it entertaining? Yes, moderately. Is it something I've never seen before in some form? No. It isn't an 8/10 but neither is it a 1 or 2/10 IMHO. Overall I think 5 or 6/10 feels about right - it is watchable, a bit better than average for what it is but not any more than that for me."
895,"8/10 | I was one of the last people on earth to see this movie. I heard all the hype and actually felt cheated that I hadn't seen it. I bought this for $5 at Walmart and rushed home to watch it. It was good, but definitely NOT Oscar worthy! The last 20 min of the film was just like any other horror movie of the past 20 years. Up until then I was really anxious to see what was really going on. Then I was truly disappointed when it turned into an R rated slasher flick with a totally unbelievable pretext. Hollywood must have been feeling guilty about the lack of diversity in its nominees the previous year, and tried to make up for it by nominating this, doing a great disservice to the real quality minority films out that year. Black Panther it ain't! Truth is I wasn't really cheated until I paid $5. Will be in this year's yard sale.

898,"6/10 | Get Out is a great movie that has arguably been over bloated from media and may not deserve all the credit that has been given. I would definitely recommend watching it if you haven't, the movie is a suspenseful masterpiece that left me clawing at my chair. But it loses its edge completely on the second watch.

Theres a lot to praise this movie for; noteworthy acting, complementary score that throws back to the masterclass of horror, great addition of comic relief from the main characters best friend (of course the comedy would be great with Jordan Peele at the helm) and above average cinematics.

Now the bad, the movies writing falls a little flat most all the interactions between characters feel unrealistic and forced. The story leaves nothing to the imagination laying everything out in front of you with foreshadowing that a blind art dealer could see. The entire movie steers you to believing you've got it all figured out, when they unveil the big twist and finally explain the entire plot, it feels unnecessary and majorly overboard.

With all that said, definitely watch this movie (ONCE). Sit back, sink into your chair, turn the lights off and turn the volume up."

900,"3/10 | I was a little apprehensive going into this movie, because of the rave reviews and awards nods it has gotten since its release. I tend to find that kind of hype accompanies two different types of film, the first being a great film, whilst the second being a poor, over-hyped film which just captured the zeitgeist and got critics drooling for no apparent reason.

I'm happy to report that this film sits right in the middle. It's an entertaining lowish budget horror, with strong mystery and suspense elements, peppered with just enough comedy not to take itself too seriously. If you're considering watching this film and that appeals to you, stop right here and go and watch it; I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

One thing I will say about this film and the hype around it however, is that it's mostly unjustified. This is a good film, a fun film, a very well-made film, please have no doubt. It's just not anything new. The biting social commentary I'd read so much about mostly amounted to using racial tension to create an atmosphere. The central denouement of course expands on this, but if we're being honest here, it's a very silly message which has been delivered a million times before by much more nuanced, accomplished directors. It's basically 'Society' (1989) with added black people.

At its heart this is a very fun and silly film, with great entertainment value. It isn't new, it isn't biting and any intelligence it displays is in the craft of film-making, rather than social commentary.

As someone who likes to be entertained, rather than preached at, I consider this to be a good thing."
901,"6/10 | Since the independent filmmakers of the United States presented in 1986, for the first time, their award called Independent Spirit (or, in its short version, Spirit), when Martin Scorsese was honored for «After Hours», the Spirit became the maximum reward of the ""other cinema"", of the cinema away from the mega-industry of Los Angeles, in a kind of Oscar of the ""liberated"" of the Hollywood dictatorship. From that date, the award distinguished good filmmakers ignored by the ""Academy"", such as Robert Altman, John Sayles and Todd Haynes, and many others who later became ""officialized"", such as Tarantino, Nolan and Aronofsky.

To be honest, today in 2018, there seems to be not much difference between one cinema and the other: the film that won the Spirit for Best Film of the Year is not far from the gore aesthetic present in the Oscar-winning film as the best . While «Get Out» is not as whiny as «The Shape of Water», but a more forceful and ""virile"" drama with some denunciation, both films are science fiction products that take the path of extreme and bloody violence to lead us to the conclusion. Both films also have in common an Afro-descendant, obese and comical character that plays a decisive role in the plot: in the amphibious fable it was Zelda as played by Octavia Spencer, and here, LilRed Howery as Rod, an airport investigator.

In the film, a white girl invites her black boyfriend to spend a weekend at her parents' house, and the poor young man falls into a terrifying intrigue, surrounded by sinister Caucasian beings and three African-Americans who look like zombies, though as charming as the ""Stepford wives"". Little by little the intrigue is revealed, although one suspects from the beginning who the villains are - in part, due to the stereotyped performances of some interpreters in key parts of the story.

They say that the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay usually indicates what was the true best movie of the year, according to the ""Academy."" This year this indirect recognition was given to the director and scriptwriter of ""Get Out,"" Jordan Peele. The film does entertain and is effective (thanks also to a careful soundtrack and very good music by Michael Abels), but if you expect a lot from it, you may be disappointed.

------------------------------------- P.S. The garden party reminded me of a similar scene in ""The Stepford Wives"". Just as Katharine Ross and friend Paula Prentiss are observing the guests, so does Daniel Kaluuya. As a matter of fact, both Ross and Kaluuya play photographers. And when the Nanette Newman robot malfunctions because it drank too much wine, that is similar to Lakeith Stanfield's ""epilepsy"" crisis."

""Black writer,"" not because he's not a good writer (seems to be well written), but because this movie has a them that breeds racism. We need more stories that bring the races closer not dividing them. If you ever wonder why the racial divider still stands so strong in America, take a good look at this movie. Extreme case of Black hysteria battling the white man. So sad ....

904,"7/10 | This is one of the worst movies i have seen in recent times. It is in every aspect a cheap movie with mediocre cinematography and direction (at best) but with an aggravating script and insultingmeta narrative.

The whole point of this film is to insult white people , thats it, is a racist movie filled with every cliche and stereotype you can think off to serve as a metaphore for how awfully bad meanies the white race is.. Every scene in this movie is cringe inducing, not because a masterfully crafted tension but how presuntuos it is and because of the irony of a movie that is so blatantly racist yet still thinks is making a point in denouncing racism.

This is a short versio of the whole script:

""See what i did there? it is a reference to a meme about race, did you get it? really? did you get it? is smart and polemic, did you get it? because all white people are bad, and she is white and she is drinking white milk? is symbolic see what i did there? but really , did you get how white and bad they are? DID YOU GET IT? CLEVER ISN´T?

This entire film is an insult to the viewers intelligence. it is nothing but a very mediocre B movie that tries so hard to be more than it is by pushing for a polemic narrative that doesn´t have a leg to stand on. The acting is terrible, the drama is weak , is not funny, is not scary, all the characters are one dimensional stereotypes, the direction and script is full of the worst tropes and cheap devices you are already sick of seeing and the fact that this movie is getting so much praise is baffling as is not even good for a tv movie, much less an oscar nomination. I feel like the world is going mad as i read trough the reviews"

906,"1/10 | Compare blacks to the deer that was hit on the road. We are all trying to find our path and we end up taking the wrong route, or something hits us along the way. Rose was so quick to dismiss the situation and move on. Chris was struggling through trauma about not being there for his mother. In fact, no one was there to ""pick up"" the black hypnotized workers. Evidently no one seemed to care about ""black folks"" except Chris's friend. Not even the multicultural police force listening to the story.

Well maybe people do care, as long as we're involved in some form of entertainment. We are the Jesse Owens, the Louis Armstrong, the Josephine baker. We do not carry any emotional feelings, we are just here to help you discover your emotional feelings, which may involve relief you whites are simply not black.

We are black, living in a white world. Must we create a facade to fit in the world. Must we change the way we act, must we serve? And when challenged, our true colors appear. We do have emotion, buried deep inside because if it was to be let out, no listeners. No one can understand the emotions of another.

Our story doesn't matter, Chris was ready to go to jail because he knew who he was. Black. We are guilty as criminals, and culprits as victims.

Black is beautiful. And all races make such a great complementary."
907,"1/10 | Written, Produced and Directed by Jordan Peele, 'Get Out' is, quite simply, a spell-binding horror-comedy, that will leave you disturbed & shocked for a long, long time. I'm still getting out of it & its been plenty of hours since I got done watching this work of sheer mastery. Peele, in his Directorial Debut, delivers a smashing film, whose timely & unsettling themes are likely to raise more questions than debates & sure to make you think again. Especially, if you're Black!

'Get Out' Synopsis: A young African-American man visits his Caucasian girlfriend's mysterious family estate over a weekend.

I don't want to elaborate much on the narrative's structure & how aggressive the goings-on get. 'Get Out' deserves to be watched without spoilers & hence I'm going to keep the secrets to myself. Believe me, the lesser you know, the more you'll be captivated by it. All I can say is that, in its 104-minutes run-time, I was arrested to my seat & caught myself engrossed all through. Peele's Screenplay is shocking & extremely engrossing. Peele's Direction, on the other-hand, is superior. Here's a storyteller who leaves a solid impression in his very first directorial effort. Cinematography, Editing & Background Score merit a special mention. Art & Costume Design are well-done.

Performance-Wise: Daniel Kaluuya is excellent. He holds your attention from start to end. Lil Rel Howery is hilarious as Daniel's best friend, who adds the much needed relief in the proceedings. Allison Williams is superb. A Terrific Performer! Bradley Whitford & Catherine Keener prove their incredible talent, yet again. Both of the veterans are in top-form! Caleb Landry Jones is perfect. Stephen Root is creepy to the core. Betty Gabriel, Marcus Henderson, LaKeith Stanfield & Erika Alexander lend fabulous support.

On the whole, 'Get Out' is disturbing, engrossing & utterly unforgettable! DON'T MISS IT!"

For a first time director this was really well done and i have no criticisms.

Usually you see scary type movies with low ratings, however, this one had a ""drama type"" high rating..So it intrigued me into wanting to watch it. I definitely see now why it scored so high. This movie is incredible! Its done so well. Jordan Peele really shows us with this movie, how good he can be in the more serious genre. It holds you in suspense and keeps you guessing throughout. It makes you laugh out loud and makes you jump out of your seat. One of the better movies I have seen in a while. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone who likes this genre.

IDE describe it as a urban stepford wives, but instead of white women, its black people in general. It is laugh out loud funny at some points. Its crafted so well. I cant say enough good about this film. Great picture!

910,"8/10 | I often wish some of the biggest names in Hollywood film making would dabble in the horror genre a little more often. Most have at least one horror credit to their name, often from early on in their careers when they were trying to establish them self. One name I dream of seeing a horror movie from is Christopher Nolan. That would be undoubtedly amazing. 'Get Out' is written and directed by Jordan Peele, who despite this being his debut film, is already synonymous with quality based on his comedic work to date. Still though, the fact that he has made one of the best and most original horror films of the last 30 years is nothing short of astonishing.

It would take me a long time to explain everything that makes 'Get Out' so great, but that's what I'm here to do, so I'll give it a go. Let's begin with the characters. It's no secret that horror movie characters have long since been a major flaw in nearly every film the genre possesses. They are often bland, idiotic, completely lacking in personality and have terrible interactions with one and other. This is the main area I imagine true film makers could improve on things. Peele proves this to be true, by creating some absolutely brilliant characters that I frankly want to see more of even now. Each character is completely unique and the dialogue they speak has been masterfully thought out and put together. Even if this wasn't a horror movie I could've happily just watched these characters interacting for 100 minutes. There are far worse ways one could spend their time.

Secondly, the film is so damn smart. There's a very strong mystery element in the mix, and the way it is revealed to the audience layer by layer is quite incredible in hindsight. Constantly throughout the movie we are let in on certain things which will blow you way, and every time that is just the tip of the iceberg. The clues given to the audience throughout are so crafty and exceptionally conceived that I truly have trouble believing this is the work of first time film maker.

I wouldn't describe the film as overly scary, but it does have you caring very much about the fate of the characters, whether positively or negatively. In a world where most horror movies are better than sleeping pills at putting me to sleep, I can honestly say I was glued to the screen for the entire run time and genuinely cared about what was happening on the screen.

Finally, (not finally, but I better not ramble on too long) the casting in this movie is the icing on the cake. There is not a weak actor in sight, in fact on the contrary every performance is tremendous. I'm going to go out on a limb and say Allison Williams was the strongest of the lot. The way she portrayed her character's arc, and the some of the visuals she managed to portray will haunt me for a long time. 'Get Out' is unquestionably the best film of 2017 so far."

912,"10/10 | 'GET OUT': Five Stars (Out of Five)

The new horror flick from writer/director/co-producer Jordan Peele (in his directorial debut). The film is also Peele's first venture into the horror genre, as he's previously only worked in comedy (most notably on the TV shows 'KEY AND PEELE' and 'MADTV'). The story revolves around an interracial couple, that visits the estate of the wealthy white woman's parents, where things don't seem quite right there (especially for people of color). The movie has been a huge hit at the Box Office, and it's also received almost unanimous rave reviews from critics and fans alike. I think it's a modern horror masterpiece.

Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is an aspiring photographer that's about to visit the parents of his girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), for the first time. He's concerned because Rose, who's white, hasn't told her parents (Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener) that Chris is black yet. Things are definitely awkward, upon meeting the girl's parents, and they only get stranger as Chris meets other people at the estate. Things especially don't seem right with the family's servants; who are both black, and they also both appear to be under some kind of possessive hypnosis.

The movie is extremely creepy, and masterfully directed (almost in a classic Hitchcockian way). It's also very witty, and full of biting social commentary. It's exaggerated, but it really does make you feel what it might be like to be a person of color, in a world ran by privileged (and usually quite bigoted) white people. The performances are all good (especially Kaluuya in the lead) and I think Peele has definitely proved himself to be a very talented, and quite diverse, filmmaker. I can't wait to see what he does next, and this is definitely one of the best horror movies in recent years!

913,"10/10 | Ignore the 1-2 star reviews. The 5-6's are valid - some people don't like horror, and that's cool. The 1's and 2's almost all reveal some racial motivations - the same type of thing you might remember from the latest ""Star Wars"" sequel. The ironic thing is that this is more an indictment of the ""enlightened"" liberal.

BUT that really isn't what makes this movie good. It is the quintessential ""good horror movie,"" as opposed to the ""good movie"" that happens to be horror (for instance, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, or even movies like Babadook or Black Swan.) Instead of attempting the drama-as-horror or serious sociopolitical allegory, this is classic horror, done as well as it's ever been done. It embraces the hallmarks of the genre without being submerged by them, adhering to the classic formula close enough to avoid the ""mystery"" label. It's got its share of blood, but avoids relying on it or devolving into torture porn. It's tongue-in-cheek, but doesn't devolve into farce or parody. Amongst the best of the decade."
914,"1/10 | See the movie and test yourself. I mean really, as seen in the trailer even I didn't figure it out till after the ending credits. There is an ingenious reason for that but you'll have to listen carefully to the dialog from start to finish because almost every aspect of this movie including the title has a race based dual meaning depending which racial stereotype one leans toward. For instance one may think ""Get Out"" is referencing a racially exclusionary threat toward another race when it's actually the exact opposite made brutally evident at the horrific end of the movie.

That's the bizarre and clever way these social issues are approached and questioned from a racially sensitive perspective that flows effortlessly throughout the dialog without being obvious. A well written script that attempts to make the audience choose what race based lens they interpret the duality of each stereotype... upscale white liberals who admire African American abilities and strengths? Or African Americans who view that not as a compliment but as stereotyping? It addresses each race equally without being preachy balancing out the humor and racial uneasiness with an unexpected final solution at the end more horrible than the issues created by each race's differences.

It puts you in it from both perspectives where the humor acts as a release from the unease created from unjustifiable stereotyping by using them as jokes that left me nearly on the floor busting a gut laughing.

All in all I have to say ""Get Out"" was a thoroughly original and entertaining movie."
915,2/10 | 
916,"3/10 | Very entertaining. Jordan Peele is hilarious and he has a good touch with suspense and Horror. I am looking forward to his next work. But, i have a question maybe someone can answer. What is up with the opening scene? if that is the guy that went missing, Andrew hayworth (or something close to that) his attack goes completely against the way they lured the others? The Daughter lured the men and then they hynotized the men and controlled their mind and ultimately turned them into ""zombie like"" but the beginning the man is attacked and strangled and thrown into a car? Was he Dead? is he the man with the funny hat that went missing. and again if so, Why was he taken that way? the whole movie was about Hypnosis, not killing/attacking men on the street. anyone have a rational explanation? and absolutely no one is asking about this. Like we all forgot the beginning! but again, I am looking past this gaping plot hole because i liked the movie other than that.

918,"9/10 | I'm a big fan of Jordan Peele (and Keegan-Michael Key,) and absolutely loved Key & Peele and their film ""Keanu."" I was excited for this film because not only was it directed by Peele, it was a horror-thriller with some comedic elements pertaining to the subject of race relations. It's certainly an unusual concept, and there aren't many movies out there like it.

The set-up is that a young African-American man is going with his (white) girlfriend to visit her family. The acting in the film is strong, and the script is well-written and very clever. Through the dialogue, Peele manages to unpack the baggage surrounding the issue of racial tensions in the United States today. The film's tone is balanced nicely, with elements of horror, suspense, and comedy. Despite being marketed as a full-on horror film, and containing a couple brutal moments of violence, ""Get Out"" isn't that scary. However, the true intention of Peele is not to frighten in a superficial sense--it is to create a feeling of interwoven suspense within the story.

""Get Out"" isn't perfect, though. The film does drag in the middle to some degree, after starting off in an intriguing manner and finishing with a riveting climax and ending. Additionally, many of the characters (including some of the major ones) came off as very flat and under-developed. But despite these flaws, this is an intriguing deconstruction of the horror genre that feels particularly relevant given the current social climate in America. 7.5/10"
919,"9/10 | Wow. I am a first time writer of a review on IMDb. I am a BIG movie fan and have watched almost every movie ever made.

This movie is a huge stinker. Totally predictable and horribly pointless. I am still pondering why I wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this painfully horrible film.

I must admit that the lead actor, Daniel Kaluuya, did a wonderful job with his role in the film. I really enjoy a good thriller, but this was not one that I will add to my list to recommend.

921,"9/10 | Get Out was one of those movies that I, personally, couldn't tell if it was going to be even the slightest thing toward a good movie... I was wrong. Jordan Peele comes out and does a splendid job with Get Out. The camera angles, and great work with lighting and display, add on to the suspenseful build of the movie. The reviews on this movie have been nothing but positive, and this one is no different!

Although not having any ""big name stars"" on the casting sheet, those to me are usually the best horrors/thrillers. The ability to make someone pop on screen, and learn about that character just through dialogue is ornately done, and makes the conversation roll like R's off the tongue. The appliance of ""social flaws"", where its jokingly basically ""white people who say they aren't racist, but really are"" is indeed an underlying theme throughout the movie. Some comedic relief, and references get a giggle out of myself and the audience, but do not let the name ""Jordan Peele"" trick you into assuming this is purely Satire and comedy, when instead it is a borderline-flawless thriller/mystery.

This movie's ability to allow us as the audience to fill in the missing holes, and ""piece together the puzzle"" is something I value GREATLY out of a thriller. Being my favorite genre, along with horrors, and having seen so many, it is hard to notch a solid result. With that being said, this movie hit every peg on my list, and impressed from start to finish. (AGE: 15+ for grotesque scenes/language/some slighted gestures)"
922,"10/10 | The fact this movie is considered for an Academy Award, let alone Best Picture shows how far Hollywood (Humanity) has fallen.

Did I mention I love Kay and Peele, even the Dog movie was like a 1000x better than this garbage.

923,"10/10 | Thrilling, smart, tricky, unique, and brilliant ! One of the best unforgettable movies I have ever seen. A must-watch !

The premise, the plot, the acting, the scoring, the pace, everything is damn near perfect. I am definitely going to recommend this to everyone since it is enjoyable and watchable for moviegoers.

Another brilliant touch that I like is how the social issue is brought up and mixed well in this movie. It delivers sadness and yet agreement and satisfaction for me. Brilliant, just brilliant !

I watched 'Us' earlier and I feel a little bit dissapointed. But 'Get Out' is pure class ! I hope the Jordan Peele's next movie will be as enjoyable and brilliant as this."
924,"8/10 | As a horror movie connoisseur, I couldn't get around this movie that has become a surprising box office success, has got positive reviews from critics and fans and has developed a hype that might classify it as future cult movie. Behold! The same was said about It Follows not so long ago, a movie I thought was tedious and overrated. As it turns out, Get Out is another genre movie that doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. Don't get me wrong, it's better than another Paranormal Activity sequel and is overall a slightly above average film but it surely isn't the stunning masterpiece most people make of it.

Just to be clear, this film barely classifies as horror movie. I would call it a psychological thriller with some misplaced supernatural scientific elements. The movie had an overall vaguely mysterious atmosphere but it didn't get scary aside of two minor jump scares involving a deer and a servant.

Let's start with the positives. First of all, the movie has a continuously intriguing mysterious atmosphere. This atmosphere isn't only supported by the gloomy plot but also by calm and precise camera work that offers a more than welcome alternative to cheap shaky camera stylistics in contemporary horror cinema. The movie features a moody soundtrack that blends in without being as eccentric as the Insidious scores.

A movie is carried by its main character and British newcomer Daniel Kaluuya is a gifted actor. The character's emotions are portrayed accurately. You can see how the main character starts as calm, grounded and smart person and becomes nervous, hectic and confused. Daniel Kaluuya is a name you should keep on your mind because we might see more stunning movies with him. I could even see him becoming the next incarnation of James Bond.

Let's talk about the negative parts. First of all, the trailer is basically the entire movie, so don't watch it. I didn't even watch it and it still took me less than five minutes after the main character arrived at the mansion to figure out what was going on and what would happen next. The fact that the movie is so predictable has a negative impact on its otherwise intense atmosphere. The movie fails to offer any surprises to people who are familiar with horror movies.

Despite a short running time, the movie feels stretched. When I'm watching a horror movie, I'm not expecting any action and I'm ready to wait until the movie quickens up the pace but some elements in the film are either irrelevant or repetitive. Instead of showing us one scene where specific characters act weirdly, the makers offer three similar scenes until the most feeble-minded viewer has realized what's wrong with these specific characters. A subtle horror movie should take its audience more seriously and offer less redundant clues.

This leads us to the acting performances. Daniel Kaluuya delivers a stunning performance. Allison Williams offers a solid performance but the two main characters have no chemistry and fail to represent a realistic couple. I could still accept this because that hint might have been intentional. What I can't accept is that every single other actor acts over-the-top, no matter if it suits their roles or not. It starts with the main character's hyperactive friend, goes on with repulsively rude police officers and ends with an entire family and its friends who behave as if they came from a different planet. This acting strategy is repeated to death until the characters have become parodies of specific stereotypes. That doesn't fit to a movie that relies on its gloomy atmosphere and intends to spread a message against stereotypes.

On the other side, the movie takes itself too seriously. The scene involving a car accident and an encounter with a local police officer is obviously included as an element of foreshadowing announcing the main character's struggle with his mother's death and with white people with debatable stereotypes. However, this scene feels so forced and pseudo-intellectual that it takes away from the movie's atmosphere instead of adding to it. A very similar thing happens at the end, when the writers offer awkward science-fiction elements appropriate for old-fashioned Frankenstein movies but not for a film with such a relevant message when police violence against black people has increased in what is supposed to be the flagship of democracy, equality and liberty. It seems that the movie makers couldn't decide whether they wanted to offer an entirely serious psychological thriller with relevant social critiques or a clever parody playing with stereotypes. In the end, they failed at both attempts. The movie feels directionless.

My guess is that it got such praise because it portrays an admittedly sympathetic black man struggling with abusive white people. It's funny how a movie that intends to mock stupid stereotypes is itself based upon stereotypes. Would this very same movie have had the same positive reviews if it had portrayed a white main character being abused by black people? I'm quite confident that wouldn't have been the case because people would have called the makers of this movie racist and the film's message debatable. This proves that the reason why this film receives such approval is because of its message that is at the pulse of time and yet simplifies a very important topic too much. If you take away the movie's intentions, what do we have left? We have an average horror movie.

If you aren't familiar with horror movies and want to get a smooth introduction with a psychological thriller, this film is a good choice. If you are rightfully infuriated by the current rise of stereotypes including racism, you will get some food for thought. If you are looking for a clever or innovating horror movie that justifies its hype, you won't get satisfaction. My final suggestion is to rent this movie instead of spending well-earned money on a cinema ticket."
925,"10/10 | Being known for his half of the comedy duo Key and Pelle, writer, director, Jordan Peele seem to be doing something out of his element at first seeing that Get Out is a horror film, but this film has all his markings of his feelings on life that he has done many times over in his comedy.

Chris is a black dude going out with a white woman, who takes him to see her family. He's worried about them flipping out when they find out he's black. He's got bigger things to worry about.

It does have that feel of a Key and Peele sketch as Chris tries to be the only black man in an all white world. He hits it on the mark with the awkwardness of dealing with a society who has never interacted with a black person that did not work for them, and Chris' discomfort being the only black person in the house who is not serving the white folks. Then like all good Key and Peele sketches the movie ends on an extremely crazy scenario.

Jordan Peele is a genius in the way he was able to create a film that was both a great horror film and funny as hell, but not because the horror was campy.

You can relate to the social issues of race being handled in the film, and it's strange because most of it is not met to be funny at all, but it connects like Jordan is telling a joke. On top of that the full story of Get Out was an great horror story.

This is a no brainier, it you love Key and Peele than you'll love Get Out for the same reasons.

926,"8/10 | It's the new movie everyone is talking about and critics are raving about, as for me, I couldn't wait to get out...of the theater. Guess who's coming to dinner? It's a black man coming home to a rich suburban white families house for the weekend, and despite their black servants, they're extremely nice to their daughters new boyfriend, too nice, something weird is going on. Yes, something weird is going on, only Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) is too stupid to realize it! He's so deeply in love with his girlfriend of all of four months, that not only can't he see what's going on right in front of his face, but he doesn't try to talk to her about it, he doesn't try to investigate any of it, he just sort of goes with the flow. People are raving about this noir thriller, when it is one of the most poorly written films I've seen in a while. Major plot holes aside for the moment, there is absolutely no character development, no chemistry between the actors, and worst of all they don't even reveal the main plot until twenty minutes before the thing is over! Yes, it's weird, yes, something is going on, but the writers don't even hint at what that is! They don't even give us a chance to figure out what it could possibly be. At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Without giving anything away, they never answer the fundamental question, why black people? I never liked traditional noir, but at least most of the time the acting is good and you have some idea of what's going on. This film is just one big circle of confusion and to be honest with you, aside from some terrific comic relief, I hated every minute of it."
927,"7/10 | Coming off of the amazingly bad comedy 'Keanu' Jordan Peele has decided to branch out into the horror genre. From various interviews that I saw with him, he seemed to bring this film out of a very genuine place. Saying that, while it has commentary about racism, it's not intended to be aggressive or hostile. It's just things that he has personally noticed. So he combined his own personal observations about race relations and his favorite genre of film, horror. The story is mainly about a black man that goes to visit his white girlfriend's parents (it's very weird typing it like this but, trust me this is vital information). Upon arrival, things aren't quite as they seem. Like the tagline suggests, ""Just because you're invited doesn't mean you're welcome.""

Shortly after arriving the mom of his girlfriend puts him in a trance of sorts. She claims that this specific type of hypnosis is to aid him in breaking his smoking habit (a ""habit"" that we never see). This hypnosis scene is probably the best scene in the entire film and I wish we got more stuff like it. The way it's intercut with things from his past and how it slowly ratchets up tension using sound is all very well done.

That's the thing with this film, though. It's about 50% good 50% bad. When it's good, it's really good, but when it's bad, it's really bad. The best thing I can say about this film is that It's a strong directorial debut for Jordan Peele. He puts a noticeable amount of effort into this film and it's clear that this material is something he really cares about. Everything looks great, sounds great, and offers great performances across the board.

But this film really feels like a tale of two halves. The first half of this film is mostly positive. It offers some strange and surreal sequences that do make you feel uncomfortable. But, at the same time, there's also incredibly obvious racial commentary. It feels like the idea for the film was created before the story was. So we get a variety of great ideas for scenes that don't quite connect to make a cohesive whole.

For example, the opening scene. We watch as a black guy gets abducted as he walks about the streets. OK, but why was that in the film? It's not really apart of the main story and doesn't offer anything much aside from a minor set up for later on that we didn't need. Is it a cool scene? Sure it is. It's all shot in one take and does have blatant satire but it's a good idea for a scene.

And that's the biggest problem with the film. It mostly feels like a collection of good ideas that were poorly thought through. The execution rarely falters but the script feels like a first draft. The main story, satire aside, is basically none existent. But that's OK because there's social commentary to fill that void. The only problem with that is the satire is so obvious and so on the nose that it rarely left me with anything to dwell on. It's always spelled out for you to the point of it feeling like it was hitting you over the head.

This is the most frustrating part especially coming off 'A Cure for Wellness'. Which not only had a solid story holding your attention but subtle, strong political and social commentary for anyone paying attention. And you really had to pay attention to see it, which is something 'Get Out' simply doesn't do. The oddest part is that the commentary all but evaporates by the end of the film. The crazy, violent things you expect going in start happening and it seems to completely lose its edge.

It turns into this violent quest to survive but and that was great and all but I completely lost any sense of satire. Which was the only thing carrying the first half of the film. It's bizarre that the payoff to all this obvious satire isn't anything but mindless violence featuring characters that the film barely bothers to develop. 'Get Out' isn't the film it could've been. Its heart is in the right place and it has a good message in there. But the message is bogged down by how in your face it is and the fact that there isn't much more to the film other than that."
928,"1/10 | I had a free movie pass, and I feel like I completely wasted it on this movie. Don't get me wrong; The acting was good, it was an interesting story, good camera work and editing.

But I couldn't stop yawning throughout the movie. I think advertising this as a horror is really a stretch. I guess you could compare it to more of a Alfred Hitchcock horror, as opposed to true horror like Sinister, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, you get the picture.

I'm really surprised at all the 10 star reviews that misled me here at IMDb. This was more of a drama/thriller. If anything the best part of movie was demonstrating how white people trying to not be racist, can still be really racist. The movie is just saturated with dialogue like ""I can't be racist, I voted for Obama!"" or ""I can't be racist, I have a black friend!"". While I'm not quoting the movie directly, you get the idea. So the movie scores points for being a good social commentary. But as far as horror movies, this was extremely slow and boring and a very small payoff at the end.

I wish I could rewind my day and see a different movie with my free pass. What a waste."
929,"1/10 | Have you ever felt out of place at a party? Perhaps a friend had taken you for the evening or somebody from the office invited you over thinking that their group would click with you. I get that feeling a lot. A lot of it has nothing to do with the people hosting or the food, but I've been more comfortable in situations where I have control. Without something to latch onto, I become that guy at the table whose going to look up something to read on the Internet rather then socialize.

Today's subject deal with that kind of fear that I think a lot of people have; when they suddenly feel alone when ironically, when there are people. It usually has to do when they feel the most different, so it does make sense when people of different color are around those not the same. That's not to say the people hate this guy, but it does express how some communities don't entwine with more a mixed race mindset. During these situations, I try to make some casual conversation hoping I can find one person to stick to for the rest of the evening. That's not an option for our hero in Get Out.

Photographer Chris (played by Daniel Kaluuya) is getting ready for a weekend trip to his girlfriend's parents place. Rose (played by Allison Williams) is white while Chris is black. They seem like a good couple with the proper chemistry. As he's packing, he does ask whether Alison's parents know if he's black. She responds no, feeling that even saying ""I'm bringing my black boyfriend home"" would seem morally wrong. On their way over, they hit a deer which prompts a cop to stop. After a bit of racial profiling, Chris and Roe finally make it to the parents estate.

Upon driving in, Chris sees the groundskeeper whose black. He also sees their maid who is also black. When Chris finally meets her parents Dean (played by Bradley Whitford) and Missy (played by Catherine Keener), things seem to go well and both act very nice. One the first night over, Missy uses hypnosis to not only break Chris of his smoking habit, but manages to reveal personal information. He dismisses the hypno session as a dream, but faces more of Rose's family the next day at a party. They're friendly, but something about them being over accommodating towards Chris makes him uneasy. He continues to see just what the family is about in the next couple of days.

Director Jordan Peele (yes, that guy from Key & Peele) has a clear understanding of what makes a good horror movie; by exploring one's true fear. He takes advantage of the art by not only staging several scenes as intentionally uneasy, but even showing the more horror-like tropes impressively (the entire opening sequence is all done in one take with no edits). He manages to carry that tone pretty well, though it does become slow once thing unravel.

The best thing about the movie is Daniel Kaluuya as Chris. Had I not seen him on a talk show the other night, I would have had no idea that he was British. I also like that his character's personality seemed like a guy I would run into rather then making him a stereotype. He can carry a movie, even through the darker parts when his backstory is revealed. Though I can give away much, I can say that this films falls in the same category of the original Straw Dogs in one's feeling of loneliness in an odd environment.

I'll give this eight deer skeletons out of ten. I don't know if I can call this a game changer, but it was still a fun movie to watch. I defiantly recommend this for those looking for a good thriller. Step out of your comfort zone and get out for Get Out."
930,"7/10 | I was intrigued by the fact that Jordan Peele (1/2 of the comedy duo Key and Peele) was writing and directing a ""horror"" film that I decided to check it out.  Interestingly enough, I soon discovered that GET OUT, is NOT a horror film.  It is a suspense/action flick with horror and comedic elements.

And it works, quite well.

Following in the footsteps of suspense/horror/comedy films like the Edgar Wright/Simon Pegg SHAWN OF THE DEAD, GET OUT tells the story of Chris, a young African-American lad (Daniel Kaluuya) who is dating Rose, a caucasian (Allison Wiliams).  Rose invites Chris to meet his parents at her family estate.  Once there, Chris realizes that something is terribly wrong...

Written and Directed by Peele, GET OUT zips along breezily for the most part, stopping for a moment for a piece of comedy or suspense.  The ""estate"" is very, very much WASPy and white bread and all the victims are African-Americans, so there is a very real racial element to the story, but Peele does a good job of showing - and not telling - the inherent racism simmering just underneath the facade of those around him.

And these facades are very good - as Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener play Rose's parents and they bring much more to the table than a typical film of this type might otherwise have.  Both are congenial, threatening, friendly and covert, showing us layers hidden under layers.  Stephen Root shows up as one of their white bread friends, who might be sympathetic to Chris.  Williams does a nice job as Rose adding to the tension.  Only Caleb Landry Jones as Rose's brother is too over-the-top.  The rest of the family are nuanced - he is not.

But the star of this film is Kaluuya as Chris.  He is the audience surrogate in this film and brings us along in a winning fashion, trying very hard not to believe what he is seeing, but also slowly and shockingly coming to the realization that something is horribly wrong.

Adding to the fun of this film is the breakout performance of LilRel Howery as Chris' friend back home.  His Rod Williams is saying out loud what most in the audience are thinking and he is quite hilarious.  I can't help but think that Peele had this film in his head for quite some time with his partner, Keegan-Michael Key playing Chris and Peele portraying Rod, for Rod has the funniest lines in and is the most winning character.

If you are looking for a horror film, go see something else.  If  you are looking for an entertaining enough Suspense/Comedy/Horror film, than GET OUT fits the bill quite well.

Letter Grade:  A solid ""B""

931,"8/10 | Jordan Peele, the comedian that brought you Key & Peele, is at the helm of this low budget psychological horror flick and his first feature film director role. I am a very picky person when it comes to horror movies due to it being my favorite genre. With that being said, this movie is fantastic. One of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. The plot is unique to a genre that is plagued with cliché and over the top violence. The movie follows Chris and Rose, Chris being black and Rose being white, as they take a trip to meet Rose's parents. Chris notices from the moment he meets her parents that something is off and he believes it to be due to his skin color. The racial aspect to the story is almost never explored in movies of this genre and it is a breath of fresh air. Get Out had me on the edge of my seat for the majority of the movie. The acting is well done and had me all over the emotional spectrum. I would Highly recommend this to everyone that is a horror movie fan. The horror genre has a new gem in the movie Get Out.

933,"7/10 | Hello, after years (about 7 or 8) I am ""forced"" to write somethig. FIlm industry (especially Hollywood) is in some serious trouble. Couple of movies are still good but most isn't - it's fine, maybe we will see something different in the future. But THAT I don't get!! What is with people consuming this kind of entertainment - really has this bul......t more than 7 out fo 10? OK: it's not a comedy it's not a thriller it's deffinitely not a horror movie Maybe, just maybe it is a very bad drama with some attributes of other genres picked by someone with very crude taste and shameless impudence of stealing bit by bit pretty much everything from other movies. And the saddest of all is: its genuinely boring and predictable.

Scary level 1-10 it gets a 1, seriously it's trash, you figure out what's going on like 15 minutes into the film, Peele is trying his hardest to match Shamalan -probably mis spelled that, and he can't come close, this is one of those movies you seriously wish you went and had a cavity filled instead!

937,"7/10 | This movie is beyond what I could have expected.

The writing and direction is so tight and so focused and there is no loose end.

The ending was perfect, the twists were fresh, the soundtrack and cinematography captured this sense of unease that just settles beneath your skin from the first scene to the last.

The casting was on point, the acting was fantastic, the comedy and humor so brilliant. I was so delighted to find a horror movie that didn't depend on cheap jump scares and random bursts of sound to drive the story forward.

Every scene had weight, everything came back at some point, I mean, what can I say? Watch this film and watch it in theaters if you can. Or at least in a room full of people. Everyone in the theater with me was cracking up or making comments and there were about 4 points in the movie where fellow movie-goers started applauding at the sheer enjoyment and pay-off they felt when certain things took place.

I will be introducing this movie to many people I know and even if you don't enjoy horror, this movie still has something to offer. The story itself is what makes this film amazing and the humor is to die for.

I loved it. I'm glad my friend dragged me to the theater with her as I was initially hesitant about spending money on a movie, but it was money well spent."
938,"1/10 | I honestly would go a 9 out of 10, however, i am so tired of seeing unfair, poor ratings like a 1 out of 10 for a movie that really deserves better.

I love a movie that i can't predict throughout the end, and this movie, 'Get Out', finally delivered for me.

Kind of remind me of 'The Skeleton Key', which I feel got unfair low ratings as well.

Anyhow, Great Movie, definitely not as predictable as most of the crap that has been delivered these last few years.

Thanks Jordan Peele.. Funny and Entertaining.

940,"7/10 | I am at a loss. I didn't look at this as horror, race, comedy, etc. Just wanted to see it. It went absolutely nowhere. I don't get it at all, it lacked any depth. It was such a simplistic story. You get the idea of what is going on midway in and what made it worse was that it's been done before!!!! Ok, the people in the original were all white but they used to be black so oooooooo, there's your race relations edginess. I don't want to say what the first movie was to avoid spoilers but it was done with voodoo, not the very weak way in Get Out which was something a 5 year old would come up with. Can someone please please explain the appeal to me especially since it just beat The Shape of Water for original screenplay!

943,"8/10 | To be honest I waited until this movie came on the small screen before viewing it. I can tell you this movie was one of the best I have seen in many years and a stand along from the normal thriller genre. Jordan Peele took this movie to another level by adding a different twist to the story line. Directors this is how you make an interesting movie and do take notes. You can tell there was much thought put into this movie from the characters to the setting and telling the story of why things were done the way it was in this movie. I highly recommend watching this movie as I truly enjoyed . Keep up the good work Jordan and don't just put out boring movies just to make some quick cash like other directors have done in the past.

This innovative thriller is one of those rare examples of comedy and suspense blended together so perfectly, so cinematically, that it will hold fans of any genre from start to finish, and it has, unsurprisingly, wowed critical audiences everywhere. I consider this to be a must watch film for the thoughtful and casual moviegoer, alike.

947,"8/10 | Jordan Peele wrote and directed this psychological thriller where he earned an Academy Award for original screenplay. Peele was blessed with an excellent cast like Catherine Keener and Bradford Whitford as Rose's parents. The other cast members were just as excellent in the their performances. Peele slowly introduces the audience into an interracial city couple. They go to the suburbs to visit Rose's parents. They all seem so happy to meet her African American boyfriend. It just seems too good to be true. Their employees, an African American housekeeper named Georgina and Walter who worked the grounds are just strange and off to Chris. The next day at the strangest party, we meet very eager middle aged caucasians and a very strange silent bingo game. Peele carefully reveals the secrets to the audience layer by layer. There is not that much gore and violence until the end. Peele was masterful at building the suspense, intrigue and dilemma. There were a few minor questions about the motives behind the secret. I don't want to spoil the plot. The film slowly builds to thrilling conclusion and that's what makes it a great thriller. Peele was careful about slowly building that with every scene and sentence. You just couldn't help yourself once you first start watching it. I enjoyed the performances from Whitford, Keener and Stephen Root as well. The actor who played the leading role deserved his nomination for best actor in the film."

949,"9/10 | Jordan Peele's Get Out is an instant classic, not just for the horror genre. A lot of people dislike this film because of certain racial undertones, but that just adds to the suspense and uncomfortableness to make a great horror movie. Even if that is ignored, it still makes for a great piece of cinema. The acting is truly unsettling, in a good way. The great cast provide suspenseful performances, and when combined with the great cinematography and haunting score, this becomes a fantastic directorial debut for Jordan Peele.

950,"7/10 | Jordan Peele's Oscar winning original screenplay along with Daniel Kaluuya's powerful performance makes Get Out a true masterpiece of film. It speaks out as one of the best films of 2017 while it flew under the radar.

I never saw the trailers for the film and so I never heard about the movie till 2019. I finally had the chance to catch the movie and the film is well-written but beyond that it's one of the best acted films I've seen in a long, long time. Daniel impresses most of all but it's also the supporting cast of Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel, LaKeith Stanfield and especially Allison Williams that bring the film to life.

Chris Washington (Kaluuya) is the first black boyfriend for Rose Armitage (Williams) and she's bringing home to her parents to have them meet over the weekend. Rose forgets about a party that is held that weekend in honour of her grandfather and Chris feels uneasy as the party goes on and all the guests act strange.

It doesn't take long for the film to delve into the horror aspect. When Chris goes to have a cigarette we are greeted to hypnotism from Missy (Catherine Keener, another great performance). Rose's mother makes you feel uncomfortable during the entire scene and you really feel Daniel's performance in the scene as well.

Without giving anything away here, I'll say that the film itself impressed me very much as it was Jordan's first feature-length film and he's not known for the horror genre. I'll give a lot of credit to the film's success on the actors' performances but Peele I think is set for a future of success."

961,"9/10 | In a nutshell, you get what you pay for (if you watch this in theater). This is a fast-paced richly interdisciplinary genre wasting no time. It's got a mixture of horror, thriller, comedy and drama as many others stated. You will get a good laugh and several surprise moment throughout the movie. I give 7/10. But if you're expecting a break through level horror movie, this won't get you that high. It's a very simple and narrow story (yet entertaining) with quick start to quick finish.

It doesn't really highlight the Kendrick Johnson story as many people have been making that comparison and they need to stop it. Maybe because of Peele, because Birth of Nation is more powerful but didn't get the same response from black people.

968,"7/10 | I enjoyed Jordan Peele's restrained horror film very much. Mostly for the acting; Daniel Kaluuya shows us the growing unease his character feels, Allison Williams is cool and reasonable in the early stages, then menacing later on, while Catherine Keener was superb with her teacup and spoon antics. Peele gave us reasonable action when it was called for, and craziness at other times.

We know from the opening scene that there is something very nasty ahead.....But Chris's vulnerabilities are used against him to good effect and it becomes edge of seat stuff..

Get Out is unique, A very different take on Guess who's Coming To Dinner. It's a bit strange, Hitchcockian. Not really a horror movie, more on the WTF scale. Brain washing, cult like. Chris's best friend was funny, a breathe of fresh air. Is this what America is really like in terms of racism?

977,"10/10 | As this film opens a young black man, lost in a suburb is attacked and abducted. We then switch to our protagonist Chris, another young black man, who is preparing to meet his white girlfriend, Rose's, parents for the first time. She assures him that they aren't racist but liberal to the point of cliché. Once at their large rural home Chris soon starts to feel uncomfortable; their black maid and gardener seem like characters from before the civil rights era and while outwardly friendly there is something a little off about the family. Rose's mother hypnotises him to stop him smoking but he is convinced that she did something more. A party thrown by the family only makes him more concerned but by the time he realises the real danger it may be too late.

I found this to be a really effective horror movie even though it features little obvious threat till the very end. In many ways I was reminded of 'The Wicker Man'; a protagonist goes somewhere of his own free will, finds things somewhat creepy then finally learns a horrifying truth. There were also obvious 'Stepford Wives' vibes with the way the other black characters at the family home and their neighbours behaved. As the film progressed the tension was constantly raising and although it was obvious that something bad was planned for Chris I didn't guess just how bad until he was told what it was. Some levity was provided by Chris's friend Rod, who was convinced that rural white folk wanted black men as their sex slaves! Daniel Kaluuya does a really fine job as Chris; he is rarely off screen and is convincing throughout. The supporting cast; notably Allison Williams as Rose and Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford, as her parents are also impressive. Writer director Jordon Peele did a brilliant job; it is hard to believe this was his directorial debut. While it is obvious that there is a racial subtext to the story it doesn't feel like the viewer is being lectured to. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to horror fans who don't demand frequent violence."

979,"1/10 | There are tons of films out there that use hypnotism in horrific ways. I like how this movie portrays just how fake and insidious liberals are but I like The Skeleton Key so much more. The Skeleton Key uses a much more suspenseful and mysterious formula for hypnotism horror.

However, it doesn't strike me as a successful horror movie, because whilst there is a little bit of gore and some suspense, I didn't really feel very scared, just curious. It needed some more jump scares and more time to build suspense.

Adequate performances, but good acting wasn't really needed. People just acted weird and/or creepy. The main actor was really good though.

Cinematography, sound and editing were great. Good atmosphere. Not really scary, at best creepy/unsettling.

It's an above average movie. Highly overrated. Not sure why, maybe cause of politics. 6/10

983,"8/10 | Get Out is horror thiller that dives much deeper into a commentary on the topic of race and racism in America today. This film does not leave you once you watch it, this film lingers in your thoughts well after the credits finish rolling. This was Jordan Peele's debut in directing a horror movie. He masterfully and subtly payed homage to classical horror films while still putting his own foot-print on the film. It specifically pays homage to The Stepford Wives and Night of the Living Dead. The film was casted beautifully and the two actors that stood out were Daniel Kaluuya who plays Chris Washington and Lil Rel Howery who plays Rod Williams. This was Daniel Kaluuya's first major role in a film, and I believe that he stepped up and his acting looked effortless. Lil Rel Howery was the perfect fit for the movie because he has starred in the role of comedic relief in many movies like: Uncle Drew and Tag. Next, the sound design gives the audience Toby Oliver and Jordan Peele work skillfully together to create the images in the film. There is an alluring scene where Chris is in the sunken place. This was very elegant and chaotic at the same time. They wanted to create a feeling of the sense of him floating in a black void with the screen above him. They achieved this by simulating Chris being uracistnderwater while he was on a dry set. Another great scene is when actor Betty Gabriel, playing the maid gets a close up of here crying and laughing at the same time while the camera was about 8 inches from her face.I would rate Get out an 8 out of 10 and a must see."
984,"9/10 | An expertly crafted story woven by the meticulous hands of Jordan Peele, with superb screenplay as an added bonus. A must see for anyone wanting a genuinely thrilling experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.

It is indeed a horror movie as classified but carries none of the worn-out cliches of this genre like an eerie soundtrack, spooky settings, creepy kids, cheap jolts, paranormal events all of which test our intelligence and patience because we've seen them over and over again. Although the main idea is 200 years old, the movie doesn't dwell on it but only makes a passing reference, thus keeping its originality. All in all, this is a brilliantly made movie worth seeing.

994,"6/10 | As a general rule of thumb, I trust IMDb ratings to represent how good / bad a movie is. But there have been a couple of movies recently that I've seen that have just not lived up to their IMDb rating promise, and this is one of them. Never in a million years is this a 7.7-star (at the time of writing) movie.

First, the positives. ""Get Out"" was very well acted, and all the characters were believable. And I was gripped enough throughout to not be checking my phone every few minutes -- in that respect, it's a decent enough movie.

I note quite a lot of the reviews here dwell on the racial theme of the film, and give it 1-star on the basis that they think that such racism isn't real, and the film is simply ""paranoid."" My hunch is these people are probably white and thus don't really know what it's like to live as a black person in a white society. So to mark it down on that basis is a nonsense.

I'm marking it down because it wasn't a particularly great horror movie, it was somewhat predictable in parts, and I found it a little weird in parts too. For example, the movie was pretty serious largely -- not something you would call a comedy -- but there were segments that seemed to jump into jokey wisecrack-comedy territory, notably around the main character's TSA-employed buddy Rod Williams (played by Lil Rel Howery). Those scenes just seemed a little out of kilter with the rest of the movie.

I also thought the ending was a bit rubbish.

Overall, ""Get Out"" is a watchable movie, but it simply is not Oscar material, and 7.7 on the IMDb Richter scale is just wrong."
995,"1/10 | Get Out is an unusual suspense horror thriller Daniel Kaluuya is very good in his role but must be the replacement for James Franco who was odds on favourite for a nomination until ""allegations ""of misconduct at the 11th hour by actresses he had worked with scared off The Academy voters. It's quite a good movie I found the subject of Afro American slave zombies slightly uncomfortable and politically incorrect. The movie came out May last year so I had to hire it and watch on the small screen and it perhaps would have seemed better at the cinema as all movies worth seeing are but I'm certain Get Out doesn't deserve or have a hope of winning Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director or Best Screenplay, all the categories of which it's been nominated for. I have only one question after seeing this movie , why was the director of Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri Martin McDonagh so egregiously snubbed for a best director nomination when Jordan Peele managed a nomination for Get Out, which is a good movie but just doesn't deserve any of its nominations in my humble opinion..

998,"1/10 | On a visit to his white girlfriend's parents a black guy finds his hosts have more than just a few awkward moments planned for him ...

Well paced thriller, with some creepy moments and a fair amount of gore, but not a real horror. The set up is nice and snappy, and we settle into a weekend that escalates from social antagonism to outright exploitation. The mood is developed through the alienated existence of the weird black characters, and there's plenty material on the theme of race, but the whole thing is let down by a ludicrously elaborate plot. There are echoes of the disturbing Skeleton Key, but this experience falls short by comparison.

The performances are solid, most memorable being from the actress playing the maid, who delivers some genuine weirdness. One character designed for comic relief is too deliberate, and fails to fit in to the plot at the very end. Direction and photography are good, and the music is cool.

Overall: well told story, but the concept is over the top."

1004,"6/10 | It's very hard to describe a movie like ""Get Out"" without spoiling the secrets or the fun that makes the movie subversively dazzling and audaciously triumphant. I even had the decency to watch this movie without having to see the trailer. But knowing the premise right away, I knew that this was an unusual kind of horror movie, one that actually makes us think about ourselves once we leave the theater. Watching it in a crowded movie theater, I haven't seen a movie this stunning that made an audience feel uneasy since last summer's surprise hit (and my favorite horror movie of that year) ""Don't Breathe"". The opening scene sets up the premise immediately and then it'll come back to you later in the film because of the idea of it is surprising. The idea of an African-American being introduced to your significant other's parents and the fear of suburban life for a black male kicks off when photographer Chris (the wonderfully expressive British actor Daniel Kaluuya) asks his girlfriend, Rose (a remarkable film debut by Allison Williams of the HBO series ""Girls"") before they go to meet Rose's parents for the weekend: ""Do they know I'm black?"" She says no, but she did say that her father would've voted for Obama for his third term. Once we get to meet Dean (the incomparable Bradley Whitford) and Missy (the calm and comforting Catherine Keener), Rose's parents, they really do seem like really wholesome parents. After a few subtle, but very offhand remarks that Dean says (including that Obama line and also about Jesse Owens), you get the sense that something weird is slowly starting to go down. Even the happy, friendly maid Georgina, (Betty Gabriel), the groundskeeper, Walter (Marcus Henderson) and Rose's brother Jeremy (a eerie performance by Caleb Landry Jones) are acting quite odd. Even the relatives and friends Dean invited are making Chris and Rose feeling uncomfortable. Then that's when the shift start to change and Chris might need some help for his friend, a TSA Agent named Rod (Lil Red Howery, a showstopping comic performance) to uncover some secrets. This is where I stop and tell you who the real star of this movie is. This movie, of course, marks the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, one half of ""Key & Peele"". Here he had the audacity to make a horror/comedy with social themes that a lot of people are still talking about. What people should take away from this are the themes of white conservatism, how black lives really do matter, and how most people ignore the rules of society and prefer to live their lives the way they think they should. White it's sublimely scary and, aside for a brief moment, not over-the-top gory, it's wickedly funny as hell. Most of that humor, which Peele is known to do on the ""Key & Peele"" show, comes from Rod, especially in a pivotal scene with a social moment interwoven into it when he tries to tell someone about Chris' situation, but no one believes him. Plus the score by Michael Abels, the editing by Gregory Plotkin, the production design by Rusty Smith and the cinematography by Toby Oliver are phenomenally first-rate. ""Get Out"" is the first great movie of 2017. It plays its game straight and the movie weaves its powerfully scary spell on you. And, to my surprise, it kept me on the edge of my seat and refuses to reveal its cards to us until the right moment when it starts to get a little queasy for us, the audience members. And in this day and age, we needed a movie like this that encourages us to stay woke. Something also tells that I'm looking forward to see what other tricks Jordan Peele has up his sleeve. This isn't the traditional horror movie you always prefer, it's an original horror movie with a feeling and a savvy social side to match."
1005,"7/10 | Movie critiques have lost it giving this movie a 100% combined review score. Look, this is a solid little thriller, like the Gift meets Stepford Wives. This is almost a NO star cast. This is a low budget movie. It comes at a time when racial tensions need help and healing and not division and celebrating black vs white. Our country needs to get back on track FAST. Movie tickets are 10.00 each now. Wait for red box.

From the previews, you get the idea of the movie. Black guy, white girl, unsure about the family's reception; we get it. The creepy twists and turns, with a drizzle of comedy, makes this movie good entertainment with obvious social undertones...or does it.

From the mind of Jordan Peele, comes a fresh look on horror. Definitely a movie to check out.

1013,"10/10 | While the movie dances around several racist cliché's, this film explores the possibilities of high-tech slavery involving very wealthy white families, hypnosis, and some rogue neuro surgery.

Oh, and throw in the most devious and evil girlfriend on the planet.

This story is well presented and flows at an enjoyable rate. Even though the main plot involves some pretty serious issues, there are plenty of very creepy moments as well as laughs to go along with the drama.

Very unique and a keeper as far as spending the money for a first run viewing.

Highly recommended, but maybe not for young children (seriously).

1014,"10/10 | Video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA3- G0rDyTM&feature=youtu.be

Generally, horror films in this day and age aren't exactly the most congenial of sights for movie enthusiasts. From tired old clichés to a never-ending stream of unsatisfactorily constructed and acted money-grubbing PG-13-ers, expectations are set at an all time Mariana Trench low. A silver lining to that is the unequivocal awe when true effort is exerted and consequently a beacon of hope radiates with incandescent luminosity for the horror world. That is the case with Jordan Peele's horror debut ""Get Out"". It had a shite trailer, an unoriginal title, but it veritably blew me away. Ladies and gentlemen of the film industry, this is how to make a horror film properly.

The film starts off with at night with a young black man in a white suburban neighborhood who is abducted in an emphatically creepy manner. Cut to African- American photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya). He drives with his white girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) to her parents' estate. They have no idea that he is black. Rose's father Dean is a neurosurgeon and her mother Missy is a psychiatrist. While they are friendly to Chris (in a rather patronizing kind of way), he becomes increasingly uncomfortable when he notices how strangely groundskeeper Walter (Marcus Henderson and maid Georgina (Betty Gabriel), who are both black, are acting very strangely. We find out that things aren't the way they appear at this place.

The true genius in this film laid in its virtuosity at provoking laughs, unmitigated tension and consternation, and most importantly some post-viewing dialogue as a result of its blistering social commentary on race relations in the United States that is shrouded in this impeccable concoction of horror and satirical comedy. When it came to the way Rose's dad was attempting to pander to Chris with some ""black"" words in addition to the statements made by the creepy old white people at the garden party about ""blacks being in style"", those kinds of scenes in my opinion served to highlight the subtle racism that may exist among some of the politically correct. Moreover, other scenes throughout the film play on our assumptions, whether we're black or white, about how certain events would play out given the race that's involved in them. The overall message is left in the eye of the beholder and that's part of the film's beauty; it's so bizarre it keeps us thinking. When was the last time a horror film truly did that?

I am so glad that Jordan Peele chose to keep the jump scares to a minimum, instead opting for tension, unpredictability, and a surreal atmosphere. We the audience are just as confused as Chris as to what the hell is going on and are equally as freaked out. The film's ability to consistently scare, perplex, and amuse the viewer kept me guessing, which resulted in some heavy satisfaction to the slightly predictable payoff. Additionally, Chris is a character we can actually care about. There is a trouble inside Chris's mind which I will not spoil that is touched on in a very bizarre but earnest kind of way.

It wasn't just atmosphere from a technical standpoint that gave the horror its unprecedented vigor, it's the performances. Daniel Kaluuya's subtle performance conveyed suspicion, restlessness, and all out fear with immaculate panache, topped with an American accent so spot on that some slight incredulity struck me when I found out the actor is an Englishman. Two exceptionally noteworthy performances were by Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel, the groundskeeper and housemaid respectively. Georgina's zombified behavior in particular is the kind that will give you some kind of paralysis as you're watching her, she truly was frightening. Of course some much needed credit should also go to Milton Howery who played Rod, a hardworking TSA officer and Chris's dear friend. Not only was he fantastic in providing some comedic relief, a good deal of his hilarious lines brought out some of the film's satirical elements; a truly lovable character indeed.

Don't be fooled by the trailer of ""Get Out"", the film is nothing of the sort. With cutting edge performances, genuine thrills, eerie atmosphere, subversion of horror tropes, and scathing social commentary on race relations in America, ""Get Out"" reassures us that originality is something very possible in the horror world no matter how absent it may be from the majority of such films. With 100% approval rating on Rotten tomatoes from 131 professional critics at the time of this writing, will ""Get Out"" be the first horror movie in a while to get nominated for an Oscar in a major category? Probably. When the audience in your packed theater cheer and clap, then you know something is done right. Truly remarkable; I say ""get out"" of your chair or whatever it is you're sitting on and get your spindly ass over to that theater pronto.

My score: 9/10. Absolutely brilliant."
1015,"10/10 | I am kinda confused about the high ratings for this turd of a movie. This has a lame storyline and bad acting. Probably one of the worst horror flicks I have seen.

Film production has been so low that recently there are 2 or 3 good movies to watch every year only. Films like these makes me wonder and think that some producers are 3 year old kids who are in love with sponge bob and have not seen a decent movie in all their lives. Why would anybody put two dollar together to produce such a nonsense.

Oddly, audiences and reviewers give this more credit than I think it deserves. Main star Daniel Kaluuya gets credit as he's come far from other movies I've seen him in BUT his acting was just barely above average. Co-star Milton ""Lil Rel"" Howery made movie worth sitting thru and stole show. Look forward to seeing his other performances.

Best thing about movie is it (ideally) makes folks think about race-relations and is there some things still going on that make us go, Hmmm....

1025,"9/10 | This is a horrible film, not only a horror film. Some of the reviews are trying to read deep meanings into it or to discover elements of humor, others praise it as a satirical look at society today and an astute comment on race relations. If any of these are actually contained in the film, they passed me by completely. It is a desperately nasty, empty and vacuous piece of work that leaves a bad taste in the mouth and a sick feeling in the stomach. Perhaps that is what fans of horror films are looking for, but not me.

1027,"8/10 | I have seen bad comments on the trailer of this movie on some social media websites. Some people think this movie promotes division between races, we should be united, blah blah blah. This is just a movie! Just because this is about a racist white family does not mean it applies to you, or to all white people. This might sound obvious but you know that there's always dumb people who will take it personally. My advice: ignore bad reviews based on ""racism""; it is an unfounded reason not to watch this movie.

Now, the movie was good. Daniel Kaluuya is a great actor! This is not precisely a horror movie. The trailer makes it seem scarier, when it actually is just suspenseful and creepy. There were some laugh-out-loud moments of comic relief. Even though the movie is 103 minutes, it feels shorter. The ending was a bit underwhelming but left me content.

Go see this movie. And if you think it's too scary go see it anyway. I asure you it's not. It was great fun for me and my family.

7/10 for me."

1030,"9/10 | I guess this film was not made for me, but I saw all the gags and ""twists"" coming as if i was watching an episode of The Twilight Zone WHICH, btw... the director IS reviving for TV soon. That seems to support my theory that he just borrowed from the genius of Rod Serling. I'm glad a black man is nominated for a directing oscar but i sure hope he doesn't win because it will mean oscar voters are not paying attention to the art, but the news.

I DO although, would support the lead actor winning for best actor. He was incredibly vulnerable as the intended victim! but it bills itself as a comedy, which i saw zero proof of...but for the comic irony of a current day white family harkening back 100+ years. Ha-ha?

1031,"6/10 | I don't even know where to start.

Genre - First off, do people today even know what the word ""horror"" mean??? Cause this... was no where near horror genre. Couple of kills doesn't make it a horror.

Plot - The idea is OK but the realization is poor. Why? Because the build up in the first half of the movie is soooo boring beyond belief and then the second half of the movie is kind of rushed. All the killings in the end happened so fast in a pretty simple way without any suspense.

Cast - The family acted OK but the main character and his friend stole the show for me.

Level of entertainment - Not so good. It was OK to fill 2 hours but the movie is forgettable, no parts are worth mentioning and I wouldn't be crazy to watch it again (ever) or recommend to my friends.

My review/score is more negative then it should be just to balance the IMDb score that was achieved by people on drugs. ;)"
1032,"8/10 | I have gone to the movies for 60 years. I planned on seeing a good horror flick this time. Not so. This movie was a thin line between horror and comedy. There were some familiar faces. Too bad they decided to be in this movie. When I saw the gross was 150 million I couldn't believe it. They must be laughing all the way to the bank. A 6 rating is generous. I wouldn't tell you not to go if you are not already part of the 150 million, but this flick leaves a lot to be desired.

1033,"9/10 | There hasn't been one horror movie in the past decade to get the critically acclaimed ratings and reviews as Get Out. As this review is being written, Get Out has an impressive 8.3 rating on IMDb and an astonishing 99% on rotten tomatoes. Those types of numbers scream potential Oscar nominations for Get Out, and by receiving this type of notoriety, the potential of the horror film/genre getting to an Oscar platform again would be monumental. However, even before seeing the film and understanding the current political environment in America, it is apparent the social message is the primary reason the film is being universally praised by critics.

It's also clear the best way to view Get Out is in theaters as it feeds the crowd with a variety of emotions that include laughter, intensity, and awkwardness. Jordan Peele did marvelously in his directorial debut, shooting scenes with comedic value swiftly into serious, nerve- wrecking sequences. Peele also have written the story-line came up with a very original concept of a social horror film. Racial dialogue was constant throughout, not subtle in the least, with most lines hitting well but there were a handful of duds. The cast did great with their dialogue and were well rounded in terms of performances and screen time. It seemed supporting actress Betty Gabriel as Georgina, really stood out in her role, executing it perfectly but Daniel Kaluuya and Allison Williams were spectacular in their leads too.

Possible spoilers ahead... The biggest faults in the movie came in the last fifteen-twenty minutes, when it took a different direction in its plot and drew sharp comparisons to a past horror film, Skeleton Key. The very ending was however the most questionable aspect taking the easy, cherry route instead of a darker, more socially compelling ending. There was an opportunity to hit big with the ending but it missed. Get Out is an amazing original movie, great for the horror genre, and will be cheered heavily for possible Oscars. However, does it deserve the high acclaims it currently has? Answer is a definite no."
1034,"9/10 | Three and a half stars out of five. I deducted a half-star for the fact that it's obviously an amateur production, made much better than it should be by some very talented people who have bright, bright futures ahead of them. All in all, a fine effort and a load of fun for people who really dislike typical slasher films, because this isn't one.

Nowadays, a ""horror"" film can be just about anything including pornography, ersatz ""snuff"" films and documentaries about the government. We all seem to be a trifle more mature now than we used to be, and Hollywood is throwing everything at us hoping something will stick. So it's fun and cool when a low-budget film doesn't just cop- out with gross-out horror or get lost in politics. I appreciate it when the filmmaker actually gives the audience credit for having a brain and using it.

The camera work is this movie is seldom bad and often very good. The acting is surprisingly good, considering that we're not talking A- list cast here. The story is strong enough to keep you guessing and the little ""touches"" that make or break a story like this are there.

So what's wrong, if anything? Well, like a lot of low-budget ""thrillers,"" Get Out begins to lose a little momentum as the requisite creepy buildup begins to change over into the inevitable ""action."" I don't think it's a spoiler to say that things get more fast-paced as the film progresses. It's during this part of the film where we begin to wonder just how far ""over the top"" we're going to go--too far into ""that's dumb"" land or not far enough into ""that's boring"" land. Get Out almost pulls it off-- but in the end we feel that we watched a really good low-budget thriller, not a true work of art that will go down in history. On the other hand, most people don't like art films anyway. Seven out of Ten."
1035,"10/10 | Another February weekend, another time for a horror movie to hit the silver screen. Tonight, my review is on Get Out, a simplistically titled tale that is from the mind of Key & Peele's Jordan Peele! How well does a film directed/written by a comedian fare, as always, it's my job to share some thoughts, insights, and opinions on the latest film. So, stay in, grab a drink and read my thoughts on this ""epic"" film.

LIKES:  Good Central Character  Comedic Relief  Well-Paced  Decent Story

Summary: It's always good to have a character you can grip onto if you are going to watch them face the nightmares of this film. Chris is one of those protagonists that fulfills that role containing all the elements you want in a character: backstory, level headed decisions, not annoying, etc. Daniel Kaluuya is certainly one of the better horror genre actors, and portrays his role in a manner that doesn't want to make you roll your eyes, outside some emotional flatness the team made him portray. Yet the other actor to steal the show (not based on looks) was LilRel Howery as Rod the TSA. Rod's scenes are purely comedic, serving to relieve the tension the movie builds up and keeping it decently integrated into the story. These scenes, in addition to lightening the mood, keep the pace of the movie flowing to avoid that prolonged dragging feeling that many horror films seem to have. Such a pace kept the film interesting to me by keeping the suspense at a maximum. Perhaps the biggest strength to me, is that Get Out has a decent story laced with some originality. While not the scariest tale to hit the screen, this film has some hot topics built into the story (primarily racism and its wrongdoings) that go alongside the character building moments of the story. In addition, there is a nice twist to the tale, which may please many fans of this genre.

DISLIKES  High Political Points  Unnecessary Scenes  Not scary  The ending being a little too easy

Summary: While Peele's writing is certainly impressive, tasteful, and clever at times, it also falls victim to being overly political for me at times. Get Out has many scenes were the extras throw the multiple judgmental stares, the rude, overstep their boundaries with too personal (and insulting) questions, or out of the way monologues about skin color that were more eye-rolling than necessary. It's not that I don't believe this issue exists, I just grow tired of directors deviating from the cleverness and pace of the story to make a point in these movies. Another unnecessary deviation was some of the comedic relief moments. Don't get me wrong, Rod's comedic relief was very welcome and had some of the best dialogue presentation of the film. However, there were moments where his scenes felt out of place, randomly thrown in there where they felt more like an SNL intermission than being pertinent to the story. Guess a comedian can't fully drop his roots. His comedic background may also be the reason this movie wasn't too scary either. Again, Peele has done the genre justice in terms of making a thriller with a decent plot that has some substance to it. But this movie failed to scare me at any point of the film, outside of maybe a few creepy stares from the brother or other staff. I think Peele tried to make it creepier from the realism aspect, but outside of that the jump scares were poor, the extras presentation was more annoying than scary, and the theme of the movie takes a different twist. Finally, when the movie reaches its exciting climax, Peele's writing definitely leaves you feeling fulfilled on many levels. However, much of that ending seems to be a little too conventional that takes away from what he built. Things happen in random succession and there are a few moments where logic (and realism) are dropped like so many hot potatoes it again becomes more humorous than fun.

The Verdict:

Despite my doubts, Get Out is a movie that stands out (in a good way) from many of the horror movies unleashed in the last few years. I always find value in a film has a good central character that has development and a well-paced, intriguing story to support it. In addition, while the comedy does have its out of place moments, the comedy is also a welcome diversion to make you laugh, fortunately in a manner that isn't overly stupid. However, if you are looking for a movie that will haunt your dreams and make you jump, this isn't the movie for you. Whether it is the lack of scare tactics or the overly political moments, Get Out's horror aspect is highly diluted in this film, feeling more like a mystery than anything else. Worth a trip to the theater? I'm on the fence about this one, but I have to say wait on this one until it hits home in a few months.

My Scores: Horror/Mystery: 7.0 (mystery element) Movie Overall: 6.0"
1036,10/10 | 
1037,"10/10 | Jordan Peele, one half of the comedy sketch series ""Key And Peele"" turns out to be a maestro horror movie director. Who knew?

The film is not without it's laughs. They're all the bigger for their pitch perfect timing amidst the equally strong sense of unease and dread. The combination proves to be really potent, and the film blends it's humor, jump scares, atmosphere, and social satire seamlessly.

The cast is essentially perfect. The film is relatively small in scope. It lurches maybe a little too hard into genre thrills in the third act, and I suppose I think the final reveal could've been eased into a little more gracefully.

But on the whole, this is a very tense, funny movie with terrific performances and interesting ideas about the ubiquity of racism in society. Well worth checking out."

1040,"9/10 | I dragged myself to go see this movie because I thought it was going to be stupid or Wayans Brothers bad spoof from watching the trailer. But I was totally taken by surprise. This movie mostly drew out two reactions from me. One of laughter and the other of fear. Not like a slasher film like Halloween or Jason, but the atmosphere and music as creepy and haunting as the opening scene from the Shining. It's a different kind of fear. The fear of paranoia knowing something isn't right in your gut but you can't prove it because you can't see it but you can feel. I'll admit I didn't find the leading actor, Daniel Kaluuya who played Chris attractive at first and thought he'll be a buffoon in the movie. But I had to retract those feelings after first seeing his talented artwork in the opening scene, his well built body, his presence, his cute dog, his commanding voice, and his intelligence all kicked up the attractiveness of this man in my eyes. I won't spoil the movie because it is an experience you should witness for yourself. The less you know the better even though the movie has rewatchability and it's one of those movies that the more you watch the more you discover or pick up on. The entire cast was perfectly cast, the script was amazing, and Chris was a smart in how he handled situations. He was a smart character that you symphatized with and wanted to succeed and be happy. I think everyone's favorite character the TSA agent and Chris' best friend played by Lil Rel Howery because he represented us, the audience in the movie and constantly kept us laughing especially when the movie became serious at times. Jordan Peele did an excellent job with this movie. It's Who's Coming to Dinner meets Rosemary's Baby meets the Stepford Wives. As the ending credits rolled and I was leaving the theater and stepping back out in the real world, I was still creep out and paranoid. I love horror and comedy movies, but as I drove home I wondered what was it about this movie that creep ed me out. It was not scary like a good slasher film, but it was the atmosphere the movie created, the haunting music, and the paranoia. It finally dawned on me that paranoia I felt from watching this movie is how I feel like in real life simply being black in the world. I found out that Jordan Peele cleverly made a horror film about racism and turned something that is abstract into something that is concrete as a movie. I loved this movie and had a good time watching it. It didn't have me on the edge of my seat afraid, but some scenes were laugh out loud funny. Go see it if you haven't seen it. It is an experience and a movie like this has never been made before. It was very risky career move for the actors to make this movie, but the risk payed off well and the movie is amazing."
1041,"8/10 | EXCELLENT MOVIE. High probability of being the first movie that I will rewatch in theaters b/c I realized I still missed some things in the movie even though I was looking for clues since the beginning. WATCH THIS MOVIE IN THEATERS with plenty of black people in the audience (I'm not black), the crowd makes the experience much more enjoyable if you are not the cheering / screaming-at-the-screen type like myself. I enjoyed the movie very much, especially the ending.

1042,"8/10 | Get out was the single best film I have ever seen in my life. This film kept me very interested with its thrill, comedy, and just the fact at how well put together it was. I cant find any noticeable faults within in this film. One other thing I loved was the cast selection. Jordan Peele went with unheard of actors which really spiced up the film. That is why I gave Get Out 10/10 stars

1043,"8/10 | Whomever was the decision maker in making the movie preview commercials limited was an EXCELLENT decision. The less preview of the movie is better and ""Get Out"" nailed it. I believe that is another reason why its a HUGE HIT at the BOX OFFICE. No one really knew what to expect and those who had seen it is not telling anyone what the movie Get Out is really about. Now you are left with no choice but to see the movie for yourself. I wish more directors or whomever is in charge of the commercial previews follow this direction. Some of our movies show too much of the movie during the commercial previews and by the time you see it, folks are disappointed and telling others not to see it because the commercials were the movie. Now you have less movie goers and less $$. Thank You, Much Success and Blessing to the Jordan Peele and his Staff/Crew.

1045,"4/10 | This movie was not well done at all. I am not a white supremacist or anything like that but I felt like this was totally racist against whites, yes I said it, black ppl can be racist to, surprise..im not blind to political reviews and the only reason why this movie got so high ratings is because it focused so much on racism..its movies like this that has this country divided in race and feeding into ppls disillusion

1046,"7/10 | The film that announced Jordan Peele as a fantastic story teller. This is not your typical horror movie. It's briskly paced, eerie and deliciously mind-bending. It is one of those films that is truly special. It pays homage to the horror movies that came before it and combines that with excellent use of dark humour, abstract uneasiness and an excellently written plot. It falls more on the side of Thriller rather than Horror but it is truly an instant classic.

1056,"10/10 | This is hardly a horror movie. This sits firmly in the psychological thriller category. There were no scares that make up what is the basis of the horror/slasher genre. Even with the violence at the end, it is quite tame in comparison.

Now this movie won't be for everyone but I'm willing to bet those who gave it a low score simply did it because of how white people are portrayed in this movie.

The one thing I did think about throughout this movie and definitely when ""Chris"" got the big reveal about his girlfriend is from a movie I love. ""Sex with a white woman. A black man's kryptonite."" - Undercover Brother

So much better than an unoriginal reboot, these films have strength and originality. If you want to see a movie that keeps you guessing, see ""Get Out""

1063,7/10 | The film Get Out is a satirical horror film. The movie is based on an interracial couple (Chris and Rose) and their visit to Roses family. In the movie every character has a large roll. From the house maid Georgina to Chris best friend Rod Williams. From the beginning you can see that the film is heavily influenced by its director Jordan Peele and his great humor. Mr Peele uses a social issue in the movie and plays it out until it's almost satirical to the audience. One of the reasons I enjoyed it so much is for how relateable it can be for anyone no matter race or gender both sides can relate. I really didn't like that get out tried to be like other horror films and have shock scares. It was a failure in my opinion. On the other hand the cinematography was great in this movie well shot and really made the movie scary. They didn't spend a lot of money on the gore aspect of this film but you can tell they spent time on the special effects part of the movie in certain scenes. Get out pays homage to films such as Psycho and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I would recommend watching Get Out it's a great movie for people that love horror as well as people that don't really enjoy it. I enjoyed every second of it made me have so many emotions in one movie.

It was scary in ways that weren't over done, did not rely on jump scares and other crap but more on amazing acting and chilling scenes that were done with just enough drama. The ratings on this movie are good for a reason.

1071,"7/10 | Get Out is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an immensely talented cast. It breaks the boundaries of what we, as an audience, have come to expect from a film under the genre of ""thriller"", raising some sensitive subjects of race and stirring a debate that can be discussed once the film is over. While keeping us in suspense and at the edge of our seats, director Jordan Peele deserves to be applauded for this complicated task, managing to put two things that do not seem like they should go together, and making it work.

The movie did have pacing issues, there were moments throughout where I felt a little jaded from how slow it was all moving, particularly being forty minutes and nothing immensely intense having had happened, it could have moved a little faster, which would have kept me more permanently invested.

The cast is all around terrific, but the biggest praise deservedly goes to Daniel Kaluuya. He embodies the emotion, frustration, fear and confusion of this character with great subtlety and depth, managing to find a great balance between the over the top moments and the more grounded scenes, he deserves all the awards praise he gets for his performance.

Immensely thrilling and different. A refreshing take on the horror genre, I would certainly recommend Get Out to anyone looking for a good one.

A young African-American is bewildered when he goes to visit his girlfriend's parents for the weekend, getting a lot more than he bargained for.

Best Performance: Daniel Kaluuya"
1072,"4/10 | A simple but unique story that explores some facets of racism in modern times. Kaluuya and Williams' performance is superb and believable. This movie is worth watching.

1073,"5/10 | ""Get Out"" is very overrated. The viewer knows what will happen about 15-20 minutes into the film. The story is beyond far-fetched. ""Get Out"" is professional in all aspects (acting, direction, etc.), except for the story. The part about the hypnotism of the main character is unrealistic. No hypnotist is that good.

1074,"8/10 | The plot of this movie is ""race"" based and that is known from the story line itself. The boy meets the girl whose family seems to welcome him very, very easily. A lot of the ""obama"" and ""tiger woods"" comments are thrown in deliberately to make him seem comfortable.

Comfort deludes him. There was something amiss.

There were a few strange events going on that made him curious and then frightened. It is revealed slowly near the very end. This plot is difficult to predict despite several hints thrown in.

Overall, the plot made it worthwhile but the acting of the lead actor was so-so, in my opinion, despite rave reviews. I felt the girl's acting was better, given the character she was portraying.

A one-time watch."

1076,"8/10 | The last horror movie I truly enjoyed was probably ""Cabin in the Woods"". Recently, I liked ""Green Room"", and ""Split"", but it continues to be a hard genre to break out with a truly original idea. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" felt like the universe had heard my prayers. A smart satire on social commentary with genuine humor, and yet a still bone chilling plot? How have we been so blessed? The balance of horror and comedy is weighted perfectly, with every release of laughter being used to reset the suspense, giving the audience the chance to build back up to paralyzing fear over and over again. All of the performances were pitch perfect (Alison Williams with the keys!), and I anticipate this is only the beginning of Daniel Kaluuya's rise. I often complain to my friends that the biggest disservice of the horror/thriller genre is that by pigeonholing something as ""a scary movie"", you isolate a whole demographic of people who want to just go see a blockbuster on the weekends. Having Peele's name attached and released by Universal on the perfect weekend (only up against week 3 of Lego Batman) gave this layered story a chance to breathe and be appreciated for what it is. Creepy as all hell, and maybe a little too believable. 9.2/10

1082,"9/10 | The story is very slowly built up and the bigger breakthroughs are revealed in a very dull way. The main protagonist acts unreasonable and never goes exploring for answers. Instead, the movie simply force feed the entire plot all in one go. Worse yet, there is never any doubt the given explanation could be wrong. Thus, this is a very boring and predictable story throughout...

The characters were very shallow, to the point of which none of their reasoning nor actions were understandable. Only one character felt remotely likeable and natural...

This is a mediocre experience, it if wasn't for the social commentary. It is not only incorporated into the story and the characters, but literally makes up the entire movie. Evidently, the focus was on the wrong things...

1085,"8/10 | The 2017 film, Get Out by Jordan Peele is a unique horror/thriller that uses satire to illustrate the injustices faced by the black community in America. In 2018, the film won an Academy Award for Best Screenplay and received nominations in both the Best Director (Jordan Peele) and Best Actor (Daniel Kaluuya) categories. Get Out was produced in order to defy the statistic that the black character is typically the first to be killed in horror movies.

Get Out follows a black photographer, Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) as they take a trip from the city up to Rose's family's rural and luxurious property for the weekend-reaching the ""meet the parents"" milestone of their relationship. After Rose's parents Missy (Catherine Keener), a hypnotherapist, and Dean (Bradley Whitford), a neurosurgeon, meet Chris, the weekend slowly goes sideways. Rose's parents are overly accommodating of Chris and their daughter's interracial relationship which culminates to a series of unforeseen and increasingly disturbing events.

The award winning screenplay of this film was excellent in foreshadowing the future actions of the antagonists. Missy and Dean's behaviour lead viewers to believe there is an ulterior reason for Chris' presence. The storyline of Get Out encapsulates white privilege; tbe setting of the grand estate embellishes the theme of the purity and superiority of the white race through a white supremacist's eyes.

The soundtrack that accompanied the hypnotic storyline of the film featured Billboard Artist, Childish Gambino, and one of his most popular songs, ""Redbone"". Jordan Peele discusses why he chose to feature the song in his film: ""I wanted to make sure that this movie satisfied the black horror movie audience's need for characters to be smart and do things that intelligent, observant people would do.""

The special effects in Get Out accompany the uneasiness of the film phenomenally. The effects exhibit many Hitchcockian elements (elements that are commonly seen in films of Alfred Hitchcock's) that are almost more unsettling than the storyline in itself.

Even if you aren't a fan of horror, I recommend watching this film. The cinematography and screenplay alone are so captivating that the disturbing scenes are worth watching!"
1086,"8/10 | What a great film. Its not very often you can truly say that about a horror film. It has psychological aspect to it as well which brings it up a notch. Well and truly one of the great films of the decade. For how much it cost to make its also pretty astonishing that it is so good.

1097,"10/10 | Get Out gets half a good film unfortunately though I've seen both halves and therefore half points is all that I can score here.

Without a doubt there is a lot to admire and I liked several aspects of the film. In particular the audience mystery was held up in parallel with our protagonists: even though I knew that I was watching a horror film my own inability to orientate to the nature and form of the threat was nicely delayed through the opening scenes. I had not read reviews or any contaminating information beforehand so my responses to the films stimulus were well piqued by the film.

Also I liked how the double issue of an interracial couple and a mixed social class couple acted to utterly inoculate our protagonist from his normal human ability to sense when things are ""off"" or potentially harmful.

After all that nice establishment of our characters, their environment and story start points I found that nothing positive lasted for long for me.

People got stupider and events got more ridiculous until only lashings of coincidences and plot armour were being presented.

Oddly unbalanced comedy entered at about this stage too.

By the final act I was bored and unengaged: nothing new was being adventured any longer and plot devices were blatant.

The explosion of suspense to scares was a whimper after a very long slow build up.

I don't follow why the film needed to jettison it's attachment to character building in order to provide so little shock and awe.

I rate a 5/10 for a film that tentatively interested me with its mature attention to character and legitimate scenario making but then completely lost me as it let it's jack in the box off for the second half."

1099,"8/10 | Being different always have two ways to go, either it will be easily accepted in the audience or thrashed severely by the same people. It took the risk and fortunately, it worked out! Jordan Peele has done an impressive job with the screenplay and presentation of the story. The clever use of passive racism and well written dialogues did their work ; they made the story engaging in the buildup phase. The sound score and the edits were brilliantly done. All of the technical aspects created An eeriness that gradually keeps you on the edge the whole time. Performances as usual were magnificent (Especially from the Lead actor Daniel Kaluuya). The brutality and the gore in the climax fulfilled the story. It makes your heart racing! Now you must be wondering if I'm praising this film that much ; then why I'm giving this a 7/10? There are some reasons for that! The Rod Williams character annoyed me the most, I don't understand the need of adding unnecessary comic scenes or humours into these kind of movies which are supposed to be serious and scary throughout ! Well I'm not going to spoil the main concept but it felt Poorly explained and illogical in a sense! The story could have easily elaborated all the facts in much more clearer fashion! The Director wanted to put all of our attention to the main character of Chris ; and in order to achieve that he somehow neglected the other major character buildups! Those were needed in my opinion. Overall a Technically sound movie that delivers on the main subject of Racism culture and at the same time makes you uneasy and scared but in no way it's a flawless film."

1106,"7/10 | Right off the bat I knew Get Out was going to be something unique, sporting a trailer that resembled something so perfectly on the fence between funny and eerie. This is a movie that has oceans of hype and deserves every drop of it, you'll never get a film like this again.

Plot- A black man retreats with his white girlfriend to her family home out on the countryside, meeting her family for the first time with insecurity of his ethnicity. He notices that the white folks out there seem to have heightened ideals of black people in terms of physicality, culture, and behavior. The genius of the film is that it takes something so very real, pokes and prods at stereotypes, while also making you laugh at it. I cannot give away much of the plot without spoiling it but I will say this, the plot twist will rock you. Never has a resolution been so culturally relevant, yet also fictionally disturbing.

Writing- Perfect writing. The conversations seem natural, yet winkingly objective when foreshadowing. Humor hits you in all the right places, never having an offbeat moment. The whole story and idea behind it is ingenius. I'd really like to sit down with Jordan Peele and investigate him for this one. There's very much a reality behind the script, and I think that reality not only applies to common society, but primarily high society.

Characters/Acting- Dude I have nothing but praise so just leave now if you cant believe me. The acting is spot on- you can feel the awkwardness, sense when somebody may not be as they present themselves, and the characters are all pitch perfect for their roles. Sure there is that Horror movie tone to it, but nothing campy or derived. Alot of moments here where the acting really makes the script pop and sizzle, creating unforgettable scenes.

Quality- The camera angles and filming are spot on, never having a predictable angle. The opening scene is so simple yet executed with grace, drawing you in immediately. The sound is booming when needed, the violence is pretty nasty but not frequent. The scares come in such a simple form that plays off of your knowledge more than using loud noise and mosterous imagery to shake you.

Get Out is a classic. I applauded my TV screen my first time watching it. If you want something that will creep you out, intrigue you, while also making you laugh, sit down and get cozy. The theme of the film is probably the greatest thing about it."
1107,"7/10 | Very original plot. Creepy, suspenseful, and funny. Acting was great especially by Kaluuya. It's uncomfortably enjoying and intriguing. Solid cast and Peele did a hell of a job on setting up this environment.

1116,"6/10 | So it feels silly reviewing a movie that everyone has either seen or reviewed but I do these for me so here goes.

;TLDR - Very interesting movie, really makes you think and gets you hooked right in. Lots of feelings of anxiety and confusion. Very well shot and put together feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone with a rather abrupt but solid ending.

I've held off watching Get Out for while now so I figured I should probably get to it. The movie is often listed as a thriller/horror/comedy which seems like the odd mix of genres but the blend works well. The comedy isn't overly there ruining the suspense or terror, it's very well included in the form of 1 character from time to time.

The tension created right off the bat and the awkward feeling of ""something is not right here"" is great and makes you very interested in what is happening/going to happen. About 30 minutes into the movie you start to think ""am I watching a modern episode of The Twilight Zone?"" (How fitting with Jordan Peele being the new host of the show). At first you might feel like the movie is predictable or that you know what's going to happen and in some ways you may be right but there are still some interesting story points that you might not expect. Overall it was very enjoyable very captivating and a pretty fabtastic movie in the end."

1118,"1/10 | One of the things that make this such a good film is the well written script. I noticed certain subtle symmetries in the story that were just delicious. Also during the movie you can´t help but put yourself in the shoes of the main character and that is just disturbing. This is a great film that is worth the watch. So check it out and enjoy it.

1119,"1/10 | Get out. Marketed as a horror but I'd say more psychological thriller with added political and social commentary. 'Tealeaf' from Psychoville plays an African American dating a white middle class American girl. He meets her parents at their house after four months together and they act a bit like David Brent when he's around the black guy in The Office (we voted Obama etc). The humour soon turns to tension as events start to take a turn for the peculiar - particularly amongst the household's black 'servants'. A very original and thoroughly engaging 8 out of ten.

1120,"8/10 | Finished watching Get Out. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film. The movie genuinely kept me guessing and perfectly used suspense to keep me hooked. It was a deep movie on many levels that really felt rewarding to watch. I really don't have anything to criticize about the movie. The acting was great, the dialogue was amazing, and the story kept me on the edge of my seat. What more can you ask for?

The movie also made excellent use of its score and sound to heightened the tension in the film. A great suspense thriller overall, 9 out of 10.

1121,"9/10 | Oscar worthy? No. Entertaining film, with clever racism undertones. Yes. Horror? No (Change the ending so things aren't so resolved and it would have a Stepford Wives psychological horror to it). It's a Thriller. Original? No. Well acted? Yes (But only the lead really stands out). I liked it, but didn't find myself needing to tell my friends to watch it. A 6.5 out of 10 Thriller that had to get marked down as it is supposed to be a horror. It isn't.

1122,"9/10 | Perfect.

""Get Out"" is a phemonemal debut for Jordan Peele who surprised the whole movie industry with this movie. A combination of his directing and writing skills made a huge impact in this masterpiece. The main plus side besides amazing plot is the way how he managed to create a creepy atmosphere with the help of intensive terrifying music and nice cinematography. Another plus was the way he handled the question of racism very superbly as he shown that it's still a sensitive topic to this date. For example, showing that modern day slavery, the black market or illegal surgeries, and many more problem are still present in the world.

The cast for this movie was another huge aspect in a success of this film as there was a lot of chemistry between all of the actors and actresses. Daniel Kaluuya as Chris and Allison Williams as Rose fulfilled their job as the leading characters but astonishingly, the biggest surprise came from Lil Rel Howery as Walter who has relieved me from the tension with his hillariously funny scenes throughout the whole 1 hour and 44 minutes. Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford and Caleb Landry Jones played the role of a Rose's (Allison Williams) creepy family very good as the discomfort escalates to the final act.

After all, I feel like everything just graduates though the whole movie from best to top-notch material. Watching it multiple times and each time finding the one of many Peele's easter eggs, I couldn't find or come up with any flaws. ""Get Out"" will play with your mind and make you wonder how, why and what is happening. At last, ""Get Out"" has became one of my favourites and i can't give it any other mark than 10 out of 10. Hope you will find my review helpful."
1123,"3/10 | Not a space alien movie so I understand why it might not be popular with 3 second attention span kids. The ending could have had more relief. If you think it's racist get a life.

1124,2/10 | I missed my chance to watch Get Out when the movie still the hotest topic of moviegoers in 2017 and avoid the movie like the plague after the director Jordan Peele won a Oscar of 2018 not because I'm trying to look edgy but I'm scared of all the hype around the movie at the time ruin the movie for me.Today I finally watch Get Out for the first time alone at my house and it the movie it pretty good to be honest but it still feel overrated for some reason.Get Out is a horror-comedy movie with a big message about all kind of discrimination that a person like me never experience in a very interesting and sometime funny way.The movie never go down with the thrill and the acting from the beginning to the end with is surprise me cause I'm always looking for a bad moment in horror movie to laugh at. It suck that I already saw some glimpse of Get Out before in movies like You're Next and The Wicker Man but nonetheless it still cool when a first time director with a heavy comedy background made a horror movie that win a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay the award that I think is the hardest to even nominated when Hollywood nowadays suffer from the lack of imagination
1125,3/10 | 
1126,"2/10 | Get out was a movie that was being talked about after the movie that covers topics that are still relevent in the US even today which is that african americans are still being abused and it;s becoming more and more regular in america in the last couple of years. the story follows chris a black man who is going to visit his white girlfriend Rose's parents and what seems like a normal trip slowly turns into a strange turns of events as the parents dark intentions are found out the cast is the amazing Daniel Kaluuya as Chris Washington as well as Allison Williams,Catherine Keener, Bradley Whitford,Caleb Landry Jones,Marcus Henderson,Betty Gabriel,Lakeith Stanfield,Stephen Root and Lil Rel Howery it's such a well blended cast they blend all sorts of talent and the cast bring out all of the chilling elements of the movie. Get out is a landmark movie and we have to thank Jordan Peele fpr a movie that is terrifing and culturaly important as it has become and you have to thank him for showing us what it is like for a african american who gets targeted and the storys elements of horror and social commentary on the USA and african americans in their day to day struggles and that is why i love this movie."
1127,"10/10 | Fundamentally, this is not an interesting film, its not particularly well written, does not have any particularly outstanding performances, the plot is pedestrian and the whole gamut of available cliches is run through.

Yet, Get Out demanded that I watch it, principally because its writer and director won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay, which on reflection says more about the current state of the Academy than it does about the film itself.

As genuine fan of Jordan Peele's Key and Peele, I was excited to see this film, especially after the universal praise the film received from critics before its writer was garlanded with an Oscar. Perhaps too much of a fan? I could not escape the sensation of hearing Jordan Peele deliver the lines he had written for his characters instead of the characters appearing as entities whole and believable.

The film was certainly successful, but sadly it will not age well, I suspect.

Boring, predictable, and cliched. Get Out gets 5 stars out of 10."

It's a good movie and a good horror movie that's it, nothing more nothing less. Not to mean it's extremely predictable I mean crap if you haven't figured what's going on halfway though the movie then there's something wrong with you.

1130,"9/10 | Frankly, I really didn't understand the hype, and I found the racial aspect quite tacked on. I think the transfer of consciousness theme was explored much better in (underappreciated) Self/less (2015) - IMDb and I don't think the horror aspect really had anything The Stepford Wives hasn't thoroughly covered. The only memorable element of the movie was the best friend's comic relief.

Hey, I'm not saying it was bad, all things considered. It was a perfectly serviceable sci-fi/horror thriller. I just don't see it being anything particularly special. I think an awful lot of the accolades it's getting about exposing racial issues have far more to do with viewer's projections and wishful thinking than anything inherent in the film.

1133,"8/10 | ""Get Out"" starts strongly, with several chilling moments, but doesn't quite come together in the end.

For most of its run-time, it is a rebuttal to anyone who thinks that the horror genre cannot be socially relevant. From its opening scenes reminding us of Trayvon Martin, to the protagonist meeting affluent types at a party, none of whom can avoid mentioning his ethnicity, aspects of ""Get Out"" feel almost too timely and on-point, perhaps uncomfortably so, which is, of course, a great place to set a horror movie.

The movie shows its hand pretty early, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The problem is that it has you primed for a big reveal, and I found myself a bit let down by the climax and its conclusion. The beginning was handled so skilfully, I was obviously hoping it would continue in kind. However, it went too far into standard horror territory in the end, and seemed to lose touch with the social conscience that had made its first act so interesting."
1134,"9/10 | I am a little confused. Did anyone see any relation to Being John Malkovich (1999)? It has so many similarities..the plot is somewhat similar, even the actress (Catherine Keener) is the same. It is a good movie since it keeps us on the edge to find out more. But I was wrong to think that it wasn't the same director from the previous movie. I would love to find out if others think like me.

1135,"9/10 | Get Out The great thing about interracial relationships is you'll never start to look alike. Even dressed identical, the mixed-race couple in this horror movie would maintain their distinctiveness. Black photographer, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), is nervous about spending the weekend with his white girlfriend's (Allison Williams) family (Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener, Caleb Landry Jones). His fears are soon confirmed when he begins having strange encounters with the few other black people around who all warn him to get out. Things get even stranger when Chris ends up on the auction block for the family's affluent white friends to purchase for their own nefarious reasons. More psychological horror than slasher flick splatterfest, this socially relevant debut from comedian-cum-director Jordan Peele deals with the racial divide in America with a monstrous metaphor that is frightening foremost for its high probability. Besides, meeting white people isn't scary as long as you have your hands up. Green Light

1138,"3/10 | A very good debut film by Jordan Peele that made a successful turn from comedy to horror. The film reminded me of Rosemary baby with the atmosphere which is a big compliment. The director even added a touch of humor to this suspenseful thriller / horror. My complaint about the film is that it didn't impress me too much though, given the reputation that accompanies it as well as winning an Oscar for screenplay.

1139,"8/10 | This movie was different, and I don't even know what genre it would fall into. It played on the imagination of what it would be like to possess strengths someone else is genetically born with. Directed by a black director, stereotyping of white and black races are used. It was more like a dark comedy about a white family and their friends they do business with, surgically turning black kidnapped victims into Frankenstein and through hypnosis, keeping them as servants, while the rest of the world just thinks they are missing victims. There are very interesting scenes, especially when the main character is being hypnotised and feels stuck outside of himself looking in and helpless to do anything. But without giving anymore away, I'd recommend seeing this flick at least once. It will leave you thinking about it.

1148,9/10 | Worst movie i have ever seen ever. I watch more movies than anyone I've ever met and this is the worst. The people in this movie and who made it just wanted to make white people seem like criminals and make white people look horrible. There is something very wrong with today because white people are always the villains in today's movies no matter if white people are or are not. If the people who made this same exact movie just switched the color of every person from white to black and black to white.. the people who made this movie and who are in it would be called racists and other horrible names in reference to racists but because white people are the villains it is not called racist and accepted. If African Americans want equality so bad we should star with this problem and this movie is very racist towards white people and luckily white people aren't babies and couldn't care less. There is something very wrong with this picture... Oh and the movie in general sucks regardless and wasn't scary and just all around stupid. I would do anything to get my time back that i wasn't on this Horrific film. Literally couldn't be worse. But in today's day if white people are the criminals and if African Americans look amazing then it gets a good rating regardless of its actual quality. People are so worried about this fact that movies like this are bad so they give a super high undeserving rating to not seem racist which is very clearly racists because this garbage would never get a good rating otherwise.
1149,"1/10 | -Get Out-

Status: APPROVED

A young African American man visits his European American girlfriend's family estate where he learns that many of its residents, who are black, have gone missing, and he soon learns the horrible truth when another frantic African-American warns him to ""get out"". He soon learns this is easier said than done.

What I liked:

Great cast

Writing and directing was on point

Slow build-up with a satisfying pay off

Good job making the audience feel uncomfortable

Moments of comedy really do work

Fun mix of horror and social commentary, all that really work for the films advantages

The music was good

Movie does a good job creating characters we can root for and characters we hate

What I didn't like:

Some out of place scenes

While the music was good, there were places where they put in music where it was unnecessary. Not only was the music in those moments unnecessary, but it was also pretty overbearing

Consensus:

A near-horror masterpiece, I feel like this movie will end up being a classic in years to come. It's acting, the writing, and the horror social commentary all work proving that Jordan Peele has more to offer than comedy, and can create scenes with tension. He also proves that maybe behind the camera works best for him, showing how creative he can really be. I recommend seeing this in theaters, just to show Hollywood that original movies are welcome and also that original movies can be very, very good."
1150,"9/10 | Get Out is a fantastic, original, and unique horror movie that is a MUST SEE which contains great acting and everything else you dream of in a top notch horror film.

basic plot of the movie is that our main character named Chris is in an interracial relationship and the lady that is his love is takin him home to see the folks and it turns out to be quite an interesting and terrifying adventure he had not anticipated.

Jordan Peele does a fantastic job with his directorial debut with this instant classic that no one saw coming. from the initial scene all the way up to the beginning of the third act i was enticed by all that was on the screen and screaming WHY!?!?!?! the tension is built up so phenomenally throughout the whole movie in all the Right ways as opposed to all the crappy clichés that are just been shoved down our throats now a days. every scare is real and builds the momentum of the movie and finally when all comes together it definitely hits in the right spots. very nice twists within the story as well that are definitely original and blew my mind.

the racial satire of the movie was also not extremely uncomfortable. watching the trailers i expected stereotypical conversations where white people awkwardly try and relate to black people. though it does contain this in the movie, it is not so terrible where you cant look at the screen. it evens out pretty well and many comments may just make you laugh out loud, spit out your soda, or drop that popcorn of yours.

Acting is superb and especially by Kaluuya with most of his best scenes being when he wasn't even speaking. All other roles were also very well done but main spotlight definitely goes to Kaluuya.

The comedy in this movie was just straight up AWESOME. Kaluuya's go to guy in the movie is a powerhouse of laughs that will leave you in stitches for 80% of the time he is on screen. absolutely hilarious.

I only wish that the movie didn't end so abruptly. that would be my only complaint. maybe add some more struggle would be my opinion

Get out is a Fantastic directorial debut for Peele in the horror genre with fantastic acting, an enticing riveting story that hooks you and makes NEED to know more and WHY! it hits with good twists and will also have you dying in stitches just like the key and peele sketches.

A MUST SEE! GO SEE IT!"
1151,"7/10 | Right when i saw the trailers for this movie i knew i had to see it. The sounds and the quote ""the mind is a terrible thing to waist"" god i loved the trailers. I was terrified to see this movie. And i was amazed by the whole thing. The acting was great and the story was very creepy. It was a awesome choice for the movie. I loved the music, sounds, and the creepy characters. Through the whole movie you want to learn more and more about the girls family. You then learn the whole get up at the end. I honestly think this is a classic. Rotten tomatoes gave it a 100% and we all know how hard they are on movies. I don't agree with them all the time but this time i do. Go watch this movie, it will not disappoint.

1152,"2/10 | It's as if nobody remembers 1975's ""The Stepford Wives"" which is precisely where this script came from. Ira Levine did a great job on the novel and William Goldman did a great job on the screenplay. Jordan Peele may have never seen that film but what ""Get Out"" portrays about racism was already done--except with sexism. Think about it... All these husbands wanted their wives to be perfect little housewives in white, middle class suburbia so they ""program"" them to be exactly what they want them to be. And in ""Get Out,"" the people want to use black folks' bodies in white, middle class suburbia so they ""transplant"" their white brain into them to be exactly what they want to be in a different body. I don't know--maybe it's me. Maybe I'm mis-reading the whole thing, but it sure looks like an obvious rip-off that's getting way too much acclaim for what it is.

1153,"8/10 | The first half of the movie takes a natural course. A white girl falling in love with a black boy is a nature call. Visiting to the girl friend's estate and dining out does look real. The opening shows that the movie will turn out to be a real good one. The second half of the movie is mundane. The use of horror amid st a beautiful first half looks odd. The topic of black and white in this 21st is highly emphasized. The movie also does not give a take away message. The worst part of the movie is ""the ending"". The ending could have improved. A new layer of story could have been added. The major flaw of the movie is that the real cops figure out the boy and girl. If the mission is a secret one, was not disclosing the license to the cops a flaw? If you re watch the movie, is this scene justifiable? If the movie was to focus on hypnosis, then what was other theme of brain surgery? It seems that the movie is dwindling from one topic to the other. The audience would have enjoyed if only the topic is centered on hypnosis only. Truly only the first half plot of the movie justifies your theater entry. The second half of the movie has ruined the first half."
1154,"8/10 | Yawn. Cringe-worthy dialogue stereotyping everything it can. ""I voted for Obama"" is mentioned several times. Ugh. This would have been a good movie if they had only left out the stupid racial crap. Racism won't go away until people quit throwing it in everyone's faces. Why not let it die already?

1155,"8/10 | This movie seem to have a lot of critics and others praising it, so having a boring weekend I decided to check it out. And I soon learned that this movie is not suspenseful, it is not thrilling, and is about as scary as watching my towl dry up in the sun.

So we have a black man as the lead actor, and the movie it sort of touched on some of the problems that, apparently, excist with interracial dating. The girl, who is white, and her family which is white, and their friends, also white, mumbles a lot of things about being white and voting for Obama (like that is a good thing) and how Tiger Woods is a great golfer... yawn... About here I was actually starting to think of golf, how to build a great golf course, how watching paint dry on said golf course...

I saw a critic stating this movie is groundbreaking - yea... true, it is groundbreaking for insomniacs, the first half of this movie and they will fall down sleeping for sure.

So before I head into the second half of this movie, which is sort of fun (but not in a good way) let me list a few good things about it. This movie is pretty well acted, the setting is nice and fitting, a few scenes are really well done, some humor lands pretty well, and although the ""mystery"" of the story is easy to figure out after 15min, I was still a bit intrigued how they would pull it off. This movie is not horrible all the time. The first half, although kind of weird in tone and boring, is pretty okay. And the movie keep itself decently in its own world and as such its pretty well made.

With that said; this movie is so boring. So, so boring. Not only because that ""mystery"" of the movie is so transparent, but also because this movie do not know what it want to be. Is it a thriller? Scary movie? Social commentary? Love Story? Is it supposed to be funny? It feel all over the place. On IMDB it states ""Horror, Mystery, Thriller""... uhm... okay... Sure it is not so common that a Black guy do not die first in a ""horror"" movie, and that although he is sort of the token black guy, he is still the main driving point of the movie. Pretty much everything depends on what he does. But that also feels out of place. Not because he is black, but because he is made so out of place and written almost as the comedic relief rather then the main actor.

In the second half of this movie we see it rolling out all of that boring stuff we already figured out, and it is actually very funny. Not intentionally funny. But when you have a black guy almost written like the comedic relief being the lead in a supposed ""thriller"" with a plot we already figured out with tons of weirdo white people around, it get hilariously funny. The last 10-15min especially I was laughing out loud at how stupid everything is in this movie.

I actually do think there is a good movie in here somewhere, and I can see the intent as positive, but the execution and the writing, especially the writing in the second half of the movie, is so poorly done. How anyone can praise this movie is beyond me, but apparently a black lead and a black director is all that is needed to get celebrated. This is really badly put together movie and although it have some good traits and I think this could have been good, it is one of the worst movies I have seen. The only redeeming trait of this movie is that it is unintentionally funny. This is the sort of movie you can do drinking games to, but is that the sort of movie you want to get praise for?

I cannot recommend this to anyone. But if you watch this, get a lot of beers and everytime someone does something which is unintentionally funny; drink."

1157,"9/10 | I decided to watch this movie tonight based on the 8.0 rating and because I'm an horror movie fan.However, to my disappointment this felt more like a comedy because my friends and I spent the whole first half of the movie laughing along with the other people in the room.The second half was predictable and boring. This was something like the ""Stepford Wives"" (that movie with Nicole Kidman) and I don't mean it in a good way. Rated it 3/10 only because it made me laugh and because I've watched worse movies in my life, such as, for example, ""Scary Movie 5"". Don't get why it has such high ratings even If the acting is overall good.

1159,"8/10 | A young black man is invited by his white girlfriend to visit her well-off folks out at the outskirts. The man's apprehension at such a scenario is suspended at first by the bucolic scenery and the seemingly genuine friendliness of the girl's parents. Little by little though his initial concerns are triggered by events that are difficult to comprehend. Strange occurrences, bizarre people and a growing sense of unease force the man to leave. What transpires are a series of scenes straight out of a nightmare which the unfortunate guy will never forget. Well acted and directed, ""Get Out"" is an amusing and highly viewable film that seamlessly blends the Horror genre with social issues. And the film is in clear and attractive color that makes one appreciate the beauty of modern technology unlike the ugly and grimy wannabe retro-looking flicks that have plagued cinema since the start of the millennium. Whether you see this film as praise or criticism of the modern era it'll certainly keep you entertained. Beware of what lurks in those pretty suburban areas...

1162,"8/10 | The dialogue can feel a bit clumsy and not as nuanced as advertised. The subtle racism isn't all that subtle and cheapens the desired affect. The first 40 mins are a bit slow and by far the most conventional. However, after this point the film really begins to take stride and Peele begins to amp up the growing sense of anxiety of Chris' situation. Satisfying resolutions.

1168,"10/10 | Get out is a knockout of the Horror/ thriller genre & a future CLASSIC!!!!

The performance from Daniel kayluuya as Chris was outstanding just BRILLIANT this guy can act & will be a huge star in the future I'm sure!!!

The story is full of creepy eerie suspense & an atmosphere that's dread filled & a very old school 70's sounding music score all add to this edge of the seat dark Thriller. Won't go into the story & no need to spoil anything just watch this dark & often funny Shocker!!!

1169,"7/10 | 'Get Out' was a very well done movie and I was blown away by the deep messages about racism throughout the film. The thrill of it was also great, with the movie becoming an 'edge of your seat thriller' by the end of it. The movie's story was amazing, and the cast was very talented. This movie was very enjoyable and deep and will be enjoyed by any movie goer who loves thrills and a good plot to go along.

1170,"8/10 | Jordan Peele's directional debut is superb!. The story is really creative and solid in almost everything with some unreasonable actions. The whole cast did a great job especially the black ones (and I am sorry for using black but it's the beautiful special thing in them and what the movie depends on) who could really reflect the plot of the movie on their faces and weird behaviours and Kaluuya did a very great job that deserved the academy nomination. The cinematography and the scenario were pretty good and that's a basic thing to give a movie it's successful weight that a lot of movies should learn along side with the awesome music written for it which was a great combination together. In the end a must watch movie that is very exciting,entertainment and well made. I give it 9/10 for some unreasonable actions and the lack of horror which is a great unefective defect in it .

1171,"8/10 | I was hesitant to watch this because it was classified as a 'horror' movie and I am not a fan of ""slasher-films"". If you enjoy puzzling movies that explore the mysteries of the human mind, then you will enjoy this film. The plot keeps you interested due to the controversial undertones but then manifests into something dark and eerie. I compared it to""Shutter Island"", ""Black Mirror"", or ""Hannibal"". If you are looking for a ""Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Hostel"" type of film, you may not enjoy this one.

1172,"10/10 | I know race was one of the key themes but they laid it on really thick. Took a long time to get into and didn't really fit the horror genre in my opinion. The scariest part is the music during the opening and closing credits - it never really escalates past eerie. However, the redeeming features are probably the lead actor and the ending. I think a lot of the film could have been cut out without detracting from the overall quality particularly near the start of the film (first half) which would have allowed the second half to be a bit longer and a bit more tension could be built in.

1174,"4/10 | Jordan Peele's directorial debut ""Get Out"" is a comedy-horror about race with a sinister twist. With its phenomenal reviews and acclaim it's getting one could assume that this film is simultaneously ""funny, scary, and thought-provoking"" (as rottentomatoes put it). Well just because a movie has racial themes does not all of a sudden make it a good movie. We get it! Some people are racist bigots. Just because this film depicts that (even in a satirical way) does not make it amazing. The film is a horror, right!? Well this film ain't scary in the least bit and Jordan Peele relies on cheap jump scares early on to keep the viewer on edge. ""Get Out"" isn't necessarily bad; it does have some humor, intelligently thought-out character decisions (something uncommon in horror movies), and cleverly depicts a forgotten form of racism. But it all still isn't enough to overcome its absence of any real horror, its inability to say something new, and its violently empty conclusion that did not payoff in the slightest.

1180,"9/10 | I've heard a lot of people talk about how shocked they were at certain elements of this movie, but that wasn't me at all. From the opening scene, I had a clear direction of where the movie was going. What did surprise me was the fact that the predictability of the movie didn't ruin it for me. The acting was solid, the writing was even better, and there was a very strange Twilight Zone vibe throughout that kept me engaged. The ending for me was really rewarding after all of the suspense and build up (even though I knew it was coming). I'd give it a 7.5 if half ratings were allowed.

1182,"8/10 | I would say this is a thriller with a horror premise, since the story only develops in the last 30 minutes. During the first hour of movie all you get are two tiny jump scares and a few scenes that leave you intrigued, but not creeped out.

I spent the first 60 minutes thinking it would be SJW movie and seriously thinking about turning it off. The ending kind of made up to it, but a movie that fails at pace and genre shouldn't have an 8+ rating.

1187,"8/10 | It's not amazing. It's a well done little thriller but it's nothing to go crazy over. I thought the set up and feel were well done but then the end kinda fell apart.

They had this cool idea and approach and then the end just becomes your typical thriller ending. I felt like they didn't deliver on the promise that had been made with the first half. I don't know if they got lazy at the end and gave into convention or what but I was disappointed with the sudden lack of quality.

And Allison Williams did not look believable holding a gun. She might be one of the best looking women alive right now but she obviously had no idea how to hold a gun. The damn thing probably weighed more than she did.

1189,"5/10 | Interesting premise, but it's too skeletal. The hype was SO massive that halfway thru I realized this wasn't NEARLY as impressive or layered as I was led to believe. Which was a shame. ""People who have nothing to say, say it loudly."" Peele had an idea to impart, too bad he didn't bother to develop the characters enough for me to treat the message seriously. I guess the motivation for everything is . . . racism? The older couple fell in love over their shared love of. . . racism? The thot daughter spends her life trapping African American guys because she's eager to be. . .racist? And how presumptive to think every obese white girl wants to bid on her own black man to imprison (the heart buys what the heart buys). Offensive! I DID get chills from the housekeeper though. That actress (Betty Gabriel) did this thing where she wept in silent misery as she delivered affirmative lines and it was awesome to see that contradictory performance. But. . . I still don't know where the running man got to. Catherine Keener's character was a paper doll sprung to life just yesterday, but she had fun with it. The pseudo science of the ancestor was a crutch. And the ""sunken place"" is a variation on a device we've seen used several times in several films. Cartoons have more backstory. Besides that, it's shockingly racist, which I guess is ok as long as it's racism against white people. Amirite? 4 star movie. 10 stars for Betty Gabriel"
1190,"9/10 | I liked this movie for presenting us in funny, scary, and ironic way the discrimination (racial) and exploitation of people. It has many funny and weird small events in form of odd behaviors which are the best part of the movie. There is also the presence of variety of people, location, police which makes this movie not that boring and empty like some worse others. I also liked the presence of typical modern stuff like girlfriend, friends, smartphone, laptop, cars, jokes, and variety of unique characters, all of which we can associate with real life counterparts of todays modern age. Also I liked that movie is very detailed and graphic. The talk is clear, minimum, and details are easily notced, for example the manners, devices, software, nature, characteristics of characters. Ending is also although not perfectly solved, still interesting and filled with excitement and other feelings. From when I first watched this movie in 2017 and then again in 2020, it did not leave any different impression than the first time. Not perfect, but definitely a higher quality movie, much better than most todays movies which are somehow unclear, blurry, and not understandible. This is one of those movies that give everybody the creeps. Most characters looks so real and genuine, for example the woman psychiatrist looks like typical psychiatrist, hypnotiser, mom, rich woman...guests look like guests...friends like friends. They all act unique, immersed, and give the impression and association of being real."
1191,"9/10 | While deciding on which movie to watch, I started thinking about movies that it seemed that everyone loved, and after some thinking I came up Jordan Peele's Get Out. Having had high expectations for this movie, I can honestly and happily say that it didn't disappoint one bit. It was every bit of what critics and casuals had said about it and more.

This mixture of a horror, suspense, and thriller movie follows a young couple named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his girlfriend, Rose (Allison Williams). Chris, an African American man, was going to meet Rose's all white family, including her neurosurgeon dad, Dean (Bradley Whitford), and her hypnotherapist mom, Missy (Catherine Keener). After the over comforting welcome by Dean and Missy, Chris notices the two African American workers at the house, and their ""strange"" behavior. After a chilling, unplanned, and forced hypnotherapy session at night with Missy, Chris is beginning to get even more freaked out, but hey at least it helped him quit smoking. The next day, after meeting and talking with Rose's extended family, he notices that all they talk about are his genetic traits, and can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. This mix of positive and negative discrimination and stereotypes right to his face leaves him speechless and worried, with Rose seemingly being the only one that genuinely supports him.

Jordan Peele excellently builds up the tension of the movie through what Chris sees and experiences, and builds as much suspense as possible before revealing the truth. Similarly to Karyn Kusama's The Invitation, both films build as much tension and suspense as possible through the suspicious and so called weird actions of the characters, until you can't wait anymore for the big reveal. This masterclass of a thriller movie, combined with a little bit of horror, was fantastic for keeping fans (and me) hooked to the movie, not wanting to miss any of it.

The acting was a huge part of this movie's success. Daniel Kaluuya brilliantly portrays what we would all be feeling in his situation, and makes the movie seem extremely realistic. His acting clearly shows how he gets more and more worried as the weekend progresses. Allison Williams also shows off her acting ability, as she throughout the movie showcased how genuine and supportive she is of Chris. The sound throughout the movie also cleverly showcased the building of the tension and suspense of the movie, building the mood and helping progress the movie's plot along brilliantly.

Peele also combines both the awesomeness of a fantastic thriller and horror movie with talking about prominent racial issues. Rose and her family at first seem absolutely supportive of Chris and his race, with Dean saying that ""he would have voted for Obama for a third term if he could"". However throughout the weekend, the all white family only comments about Chris's race and his genetic traits. This underlying racism that some people say and use is usually hard to portray clearly, but Peele has portrayed it marvelously. Peele has included some stereotypes of both African American and white people, which may or may not be true and anger some people. However, his main message about talking about and showing underlying racism from people who were presumed as not racist was clearly shown, and Peele remarkably combined that powerful message with a stunning movie.

Jordan Peele's Get Out deserves all of the praise that has been said about it. It skillfully talks about a prominent social issue while still providing entertainment to its viewers. Believe me, while watching this movie, you won't want to get out of your seat for anything."

1194,"9/10 | When I watched ""Get Out"", I had no idea of ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975) existence. So my first thoughts were ""clever, intelligent, alternate representation of racism, authentic, prototypical, unique"". One day I wanted to watch a high quality classic film, preferably horror. And this is how I found ""The Stepford Wives"" (1975). After watching this film, I started to realise that had many similarities with ""Get Out"". According to the producer of this film, ""The Stepford Wives"" was a big influence for the making of this film.

So my review had to be changed. One of the main ideas, the brainwashing, was the same, but for the different reasons. I appreciated the fact that they used this specific social problem as the main topic of the film (racism) in combination with science, biology, hypnosis etc.

Let's get in the plot. I really liked the fact that we had a really clever protagonist from the beginning of this film. Unfortunately it lacks in many films. I liked how the mystery was unfolding. ""Creepy"" is the suitable word.

Very good performances. Especially doctor and the servant's one. The directing was also very good. But the most important thing was the fact that there are many memorable scenes from this film, that are hard to forget. I don't want to forget.

The gore is mediocre, but is visible mostly at the end of the film. It also contains much agony, which I love and of course it contains some comedic scenes by the protagonist's friend. I really enjoyed watching this film.

In conclusion, is this film authentic? Yes and No. Is there parthenogenesis in art? Not at all. Was this film creative? Way more creative than you think, since it blended many topics into one. It still gives me chills.

Highly recommended!"
1195,"5/10 | Jordan Peele's directorial debut is certainly impressive, who would know that a man mostly regraded for comedy can make an intriguing horror drama? I really like this film, but what i mean by the title is that the 1st and 2nd act are great, but the 3rd act is what let's it down

The third act isn't bad, but it's not as good as the previous 2. Peele does such a good job at building up Tension in this seemingly normal place that you kind of want it to pay off well. This is probably personal, I think that a film like this shouldn't have ended in a blood bath, but again that's just me

1197,"3/10 | ""Get Out"" is about racism. I know this statement is groundbreaking, but I would say it anyway. I, a white guy, have watch thousands of movies about this topic so I recognize what I talk about when I talk about racism.

Of course I'm joking. I don't know a lot about racism but is unnecessary to watch this movie, is a really entertaining movie even if you don't get the social commentary in the story.

The acting is on point. The twist are unexpected and the last 40 minutes are worthy of all your money. So go ahead and give it a try, it's a decent movie.

Oh but before you watch it, be aware this isn't a horror movie that will frighten you with jumpscares, it's more like a dramedy with thriller. It's unscary is what I'm trying to say.

1198,"3/10 | This movie definitely lives up to all the hype and talk about it. It's been awhile since it came out, however, it is still a great movie to watch even now; and I believe that it is going to be relevant in the future as well. The character development is strong; stronger than most movies that are written. This one is beautifully written from beginning to end. This movie isn't like all the other horror movies that seem to be cliche from the start of it. The plot flows with plot twists and suspense. The premise of this movie seems to be something that can actually happen within our society and the society in the future as well.

1208,"10/10 | I watched this film during my Horror Film course this semester. Prior to the last session, I had no idea what the film was about or even that it was so new.

Jordan Peele takes viewers on an emotional journey in this film. Just as the viewer gets comfortable with the direction of the plot, he throws several twist and turns into the mix to keep things fun and exciting. I would have thought that Jordan Peele writing a horror film would be lead in a more comedic direction with a few small elements of scary. He does the exact opposite!! This film left me guessing and on the edge of my seat.

Get Out gives the viewer more of a mental scare, as Peele stays away from the typical cheap jump scares you might be expecting. I could watch this film again and again while still finding a different element to ponder and evaluate.

The actors in the film are just amazing; how they can hold their cool in such obscure situations is baffling. The film deserves awards that it did not have the chance to win. Being able to combine horror and comedy in a well-balanced film deserves much more recognition. I would truly like to see another horror film from Jordan Peele, as I feel he has found a way to create a new, more modern horror film.

To anyone who is looking for the psychological thrill, this film will make you feels many uncomfortable things, but it will offer you the opportunity to see the world in a different way and maybe evaluate your past and future."

1221,"10/10 | First time director Jordan Peele (as in the one of lead stars from the comedy TV series Key & Peele) brings us a new, fresh and very unexpected film for cinema lovers. Get Out is aimed at the genre of horror and thriller with a little touch of good humor. Get Out tells the story of a young African-American male, ""Chris"", who agrees to finally visit his Caucasian girlfriend's family at their home estate.

Upon arrival everything appears to be what you would expect when meeting a girlfriend's parents. However, within a matter of time...strange things start occurring around the family home. Chris begins to become concerned and curious. And, in order not to spoil the film's plot, this is all I'm going to say.

While watching Get Out I discovered that I was having a really great time. With so many sequels and reboots this year, Get Out felt like I was breathing in clean fresh air. The genre of Horror/Thriller must be very challenging by today's standards to come up with fresh and creative ideas. Considering, as I said above, this is Jordan Peele's 1st official film with him directing, the end results are very good.

Get Out does a fantastic job at keeping the film suspenseful and the viewer hooked until the end credits. At no point did I check my watch because I was bored. I was completely pulled into the film's plot and I wasn't leaving the cinemas until I got answers and explanations for all the strange things Chris was discovering around him.

The film also has an outstanding audio track. The clever use of eerie music throughout will suddenly switch to a well known classic song, letting the audience know that it's ok to have fun with this movie. Jordan Peele's camera work is also something to be praised. The clever use of multiple angles and slow panning is something that I would call ""Hitchcock"" style. Many times throughout the film I was watching something that shocked me or had me in suspense, but no matter what, I couldn't help it but to have a smile on my face too. When I see s scary movie, I am a man who doesn't normally jump out of his seat. But this movie, got me to jump twice (once even yelling at the cinema screen!).

Get Out is a film that Finesse Movie Reviews suggest you shouldn't miss in 2017. I feel it's a film that will really surprise and I recommend this for those who enjoy an interesting story with suspenseful moments. The film does have a couple of faults to be sure, but they are so minor I refuse to talk about them online. I found the film to be unpredictable, but even when I knew something was coming... I was so keen to see it happen as this film had me very Invested in it.

Could have been great. Really great, IF the story would have taken a totally different turn. BUT it didnt, so therefore only 5 stars for a really good promising start and a scary middle part of the story.

Like the reality of today's society, people are putting on smiles as if everything is perfect, yet there is something barely under the surface that is is more than disturbing. I don't want to spoil anything, but rent this thriller that will have you laughing, and curled up in the corner all at the same time. Not one ""jump scare"" in the entire movie, yet effectively immerses you into a dark place that is much more frightening than a camp in the woods with a hockey mask wearing maniac. At least there you know what to be afraid of. Rent this tosay

1237,"10/10 | I honestly don't get why critics loved this thing so much. It did not deserve the Oscar consideration that it got. The only real reason it got nominated so many times was to avoid the ""Oscars so white"" stigma that SJWs always bring up every year. Now don't get me wrong, it's a decent, enjoyable movie, but it isn't really as smart of a metaphor on racism and the black experience in America as people think it is. It's not really very scary, either. To sum up my thoughts of the movie, it's decent, there are a couple great scenes, acting is alright, but it's not amazing and in no way deserving of the hype it got from critics. But i guess that makes me racist now, since I didn't think a movie starring, written, and directed by African American people is amazing. Whatever. Feeling a strong 6 to a light 7 on this one.

1238,"9/10 | I saw the trailer on a 'best horrors of 2017' list and must admit, nothing made me want to watch it. However, the reviews are excelent so I became intrigued and sat down to watch.

So glad I did.

Its gripping and funny. Keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I can't fault it at all.

1240,"8/10 | This movie plays like a modern Twilight Zone episode, but is not really typical horror per se. At best, it's just kind of weird with some odd humor thrown in here or there, and there is really only one (very quick) gory scene.

I don't really get the hype, but it was worth it to watch what amounts to a really good start for a first time writer/director. I look forward to more future work by Jordan Peele.

1242,"10/10 | Get Out is a slowly accelerating descent into horror, that makes you both uncomfortable and wanting to laugh out loud about the sheer madness of the plot. Said plot is, to be fair, not very original but rather derivative of other socially aware horror films. Yes, it is a kind of a horror film, with social commentary on US race relations, flashes of a very dysfunctional family drama, but it is also surprisingly funny: a true horror dramedy I'd say with its greatest asset being the actors. Most of all, Daniel Kaluuya and his performance stand out. The three acts of the film are tonally different. There is always this unnerving sense of darkness which makes for great suspense (Jordan Peele knows his Hitchcock!), but the transitions are interesting. Especially the third act suddenly becomes very Tarantino-esk and I had to laugh quite a bit. It is not the best film of 2017 but it is a genuine surprise, well crafted and acted.

1254,"9/10 | Jordan Peele masterfully creates an engaging hero, a mysterious atmosphere, and an action-filled story that never lets up. Get Out is a suspenseful film full of humor. It explores a lot of social issues revolving around racism in the U.S. Get Out really isn't a horror film (which is what I thought it was going to be). I think Jordan Peele called it a social thriller, and that seems right to me.

Get Out is for everyone. I saw this with a mixed audience, and as far as I could tell, everyone loved it. Because Get Out deals with how we treat one another, I think it's best to see it in a theater with other people. I'm sure it will translate well to a small screen, but it was great to see it as part of a group.

The movie also paints a picture that white people are evil (which seems true enough now, but not in 2017) and scary, which wasn't true when this film came out.

1266,"5/10 | ""Get Out"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch an African-American visiting his white girlfriend's parents. Everything goes very well until some strange events and behaviors occur.

I liked this horror movie very much because it was a big surprise for me. I did have high expectations by it but still I was surprised not only with the clever plot but also with the amazing direction of it. The interpretations of both Daniel Kaluuya who played as Chris Washington and Allison Williams who played as Rose Armitage were simply exceptional. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Catherine Keener's who played as Missy Armitage, Marcus Henderson's who played as Walter and Bradley Whitford's who played as Dean Armitage, and they were all very good. I highly recommend it to every horror movie fan because I am sure that after watching it, it will be one of the best horror movie you had ever watched.

1270,"4/10 | I heard much good about this movie, so I had high hopes. From the very first line of the movie, Get Out beats you over the head with it's themes of racism. There was no tact or subtlety of emotional persuation. The film simply tells you how to feel, which was at times confusing. For example, when the couple first meets the parents, the parents seem friendly. But simply the young couple's uncomfortable reactions to the parents TELLS you to ""feel awkward"" because ""this is an awkward encounter,"" even though the parents did nothing (yet) to elicit this kind of uncomfortable behavior. It really shows a weakness in writing when the theme of the movie is it's only real content. The main character was hopelessly uninteresting and, although the cast showed some potential talent, the eye-rolling moments throughout their interactions took away from any real substance. This is what happens when the ""message"" of the movie takes precedence over actual good film making. There were moments that felt like what would have made a great comedy sketch about racism, which makes sense give Jordan Peele's comedic background. But instead, these ridiculous and absurd moments were actually taken seriously. I honestly had to start doing the 10-second skip-ahead on my laptop because I couldn't bear a lot of this movie.

Oh and then there is the girlfriend's sudden physical transformation when we ""realize"" (as if it's not already obvious) that she's in on the slavery ploy. Hhmm perhaps making her look like a distopian lab woman rather than the normal girl she was the whole time should make us less sympathetic towards her when she dies? You'd think the fact that she's pretending to love men to lure them into slavery would be enough. All-in-all, this movie was not worth the $3.99 Amazon price I paid for it and was a sad waste of my time."
1271,"8/10 | A brilliant movie in many ways, performances, script, production design, cinematography.

I do not, however, agree with its 'racial' critiques which do not carry over to countries outside of the USA. None of my friends understood these critiques of corrupt and racist police forces, it just felt like another element of the story in an american landscape.

To reiterate: not a good social commentary, but a brilliant

1274,"7/10 | The synopsis of Get Out doesn't give a clue as to what the film is really about. I was expecting a modern deep film on interracial couples. There have been a few films made about this topic already and we're in the 21st century already. I was pleasantly surprised. Get Out gives you a great thriller experience with a unique twist. The traditional kind of racism or ignorance you expect is not what you think. People are somewhat fascinated and want superior physical bodies.

These kind of cult or secretive groups in film are very interesting. This is a great new spin on it. I enjoyed it from start to end and was on the edge of my seat. Definitely worth a watch 8/10

1278,"7/10 | I seen this movie when it came out. I was 16 at the time and in that time I had a different outlook on movies. And as my taste in films matured time by time, I still manage to love this movie as much as I did when I seen it the first time in theaters. They're so many great things about the movie I kinda struggle to find one single issue to not make it a 5 star movie. The acting is phenomenal. The characters are lovely. It has that old fashioned feeling that horror should have. It is funny and intense and it switches tones without it feeling awkward. The humor of the film isn't like quippy or anything like that, it's more like the awkward situation that the main character Chris occurs and how he handles it. And I love that. But besides all of that, the best thing in the film to me was the pacing. Nothing never felt forced, and scenes never dragged. It has a very tight script and because of that I never got bored. And that right there is why this movie is an instant classic to me.

1279,"7/10 | I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. It was listed as a horror yet didn't really seem that way until about halfway through. I hadn't watched any trailers previously nor did I really know what the movie was about....... all I knew going in was that it got really good reviews. I was very surprised at how good it was and I was on the edge of my seat right up until the very end. The acting was really superb I felt. The movie had really creepy tones throughout but I still could not figure out where it was going. Finally at the end they have the big reveal and it all comes together. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and am looking forward to watching US after watching this. An intelligent thriller with great acting and great directing. The music is a great addition to the creepiness and I really liked the goofy best friend.

1280,"8/10 | I finally got around to watching this, after hearing only good things my expectations were high. The guy I watched it with fell asleep. He had the right idea. This was just an overwrought mess of a movie. The pacing was bad. Slow with little pay off. The tone is all over the place, the comedic parts not funny and shouldn't even be in the movie. Worst of all for this genre: It's not scary.

Maybe not being American is part of it. Then again, if this was a good horror film that shouldn't be that important. Social commentary can be in a horror movie but in this case the lack of subtlety kept taking me out of the experience. Being boring is the cardinal sin of horror movies, for that alone I do not recommend. The ominous parts before the plot takes off and some good performances is the only reason I give it 3/10.

1292,"7/10 | Disclaimer! If you watch this black-mirror style movie you might start doubting the true motives behind inter-human relationships, become skeptical of your significant others actions and mainly start questioning the nature of your socializing world. I'm dramatizing.

However, the plot of the movie is superb, acting is amazing and the soundtrack fits perfectly. Unfortunately quite unscientific when it come to its medical procedures and references to hypnosis.Nevertheless, still a worth watch. Touching on the inherent xenophobia of humans and highly ting its subtle manifestations, the movie portraits the vestiges of alleged race differences and white supremacy.

It will keep you engaged and excited. It makes a great job of spiking emotions and getting you out of your monotonous existence.

Get Out is a wonderfully Thriller from Jordan Peele, with an original premise and a well crafted performance from Daniel Kalyuua, Get Out is most definitely one of the best horror/thrillers ever made, and a fantastic first venture from Jordan Peele, my only complaint is that the film seems to get too much love, as well as too much hate. The film is a fantastic venture and it's topics on race are very well touched upon. If you're looking for an artistic Thoughtful thriller, this is the film for you.

1295,"7/10 | A reimagination of the African American experience through the guise of a horror story, following all the traditions associated with the genre, that places, arguably for the first time in the history of popular film, the victim and dupe of the monsters as being distinguished by their marginalised status through race. The film takes no shame in its identification with tradition given that it needs the audience to have some sense of familiarity in order for its messages to get across. For example, we know just by seeing the daunting, panning-out scene of Rose's parents' house, isolated in the middle of the forest, what implications are held in store for Chris in regards to the various levels of sanity he will encounter, the role he will play in relation to the people he will encounter, and the foreboding moral decline that awaits him because we have read Edgar Allan Poe. What we don't know, however, is specifically what struggles await him, and what he will need to do to overcome them. It is through this anticipation, one which we have nurtured over the course of all the horror movies we have hitherto watched, that we become most surprised, given that what we expect as being unfamiliar is inevitably familiar to an overwhelmingly uncomfortable degree. This is because as fantastical as the film's premise is, it alludes to a repression that pervaded a large part of American history which we are ultimately forced to recognise within ourselves. The final scene of the film is so effective for this reason, and consequently draws us to think quite deeply about what it is that causes us to react the way we do."
1296,"5/10 | Although this movie was entertaining it was very confusing. I didn't get the theme this movie was trying to get across. If you ignore how little since this movie makes then it makes it an interesting horror movie. It is different from some of the other movies that I have seen through out my years. It wasn't what i was expecting and has a weird plot twist. But then again... what was the point?

1297,"5/10 | Director Jordan Peele leaves audiences and critics around the world speechless and mesmerized with his incredibly successful and powerful debut film Get Out. The immaculate horror/thriller comedy is successful in giving viewers a truly unique and horrific experience that goes far beyond typical horror cliches by delving into themes of modern day racism. The plot focuses around a young and ubran, biracial couple of Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), an African American man, and Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), a white woman. In the film the couple ventures off on a weekend excursion to visit her parents, Dean (Bradley Whitford) and Missy (Catherine Keener) Armitage, who have never met Chris and who are also completely unaware of Chris's ethnic background. Chris questions whether Rose's parents will approve of him because of his color, but Rose assures him that his parents are blind to race. When they arrive, Chris quickly picks up on Rose's parents attempts to accommodate Chris's racial background, such as stating that if they could they would vote for Obama for a third term. However, as the weekend advances Chris find himself in some rather disturbing and frightening experiences that makes him question Rose and her family's values and beliefs. When he finally becomes aware of the family's true and deviant intents, Chris decides that in order to survive he needs to Get Out! Audiences and critics alike were absolutely shocked to learn that the infamously comedic actor Jordan Peele, who has started in television shows and movies such as Key & Peele and Keanu, would be making his directorial debut with a horror movie, a genre which is generally not favored by the film industry. Because of his minimal background with the genre, many doubted that the film would be of any substance and most assumed that it would be a box office flop. To everyone's surprise however, viewers found that the film was loaded with skin-crawling scenes, dark humor, and numerous cryptic messages that relate to society as a whole. Jordan Peele's unique directing style, accompanied by strong cast performances, as well as the film's ability to dive into controversial topics, greatly strengthens the film's reputation as one of the best horror films ever made. One of Peele's greatest attributes as a director is his ability to convey strong and important messages within his films through an abundance of small yet important details that strengthen the viewer's understanding of the plot and theme, which in the case of Get Out is modern day racism. Peele's ability to blend and hide important themes and plot points within small details puts directors such as Kubrick to shame. Popular scenes such as the black car scene, the cereal scene, the deer scene, the shotgun scene and the running scene all help to bring the plot together as well as strengthen the film's recurring theme of racism in the twenty first century. Peele was even able to utilize the critically acclaimed song Redbone by rapper Childish Gambino to help foreshadow the events of the film. Another one of Peele's greatest attributes as a director is his ability to create a truly unique and original film that steers away from the overused cliches that are so prevalent in modern horror films. Instead of creating a film that was loaded with cliches such as excessive gore, falling female protagonists and stupid teenagers, Peele focuses on showcasing the true and complex terrors of modern day racism, such as police brutality, injustice in the court system, the erasure of black culture, and the systematic oppression of African Americans in America. Although the plot is a little far fetched, many still find that they are able relate to what Chris feels and goes through over the duration of the film. The spectacular performances within this film also contribute to Get Out's reputation as one of the greatest horror films ever made. Daniel Kaluuya's incredible performance gives audiences a believable look into the reality of African American males in modern day America, as well as showcases the recurring oppression that many African Americans face. Throughout the film, audiences feel Chris's genuine sense of caution when visiting Rose's all white family. His performance further communicates how African Americans feel in the presence of police officers and in situations when African Americans are made to feel uncomfortable. Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener also believably portray the way in which many modern whites view and treat African Americans. They overemphasize the fact that Chris is black in a failed attempt to make him feel more comfortable, rather than focusing on him as a person. They also utilize stereotypes to generalize the African American race and culture through scenes like the Obama scene and the running scene. These performances give the film a realistic sense by accurately characterizing the hidden racism that is all to prevalent in the country today. Get Out is one hell of a film that will surely keep viewers on the edge of their seats, and the terror that the audience experiences will surely stay with them far past the end credits. With its sense of dread, terror, comedy, and underlying societal themes, Get Out very well may be one of the greatest horror films ever made."

1300,"6/10 | ""Get Out"" is a good horror movie that could have been better. The potential was there, but it fell back on conventions at the climax, which made it ordinary. It's definitely not a bad movie, but the rating on here is too high. It is more like a 6-6.5 type of horror movie. It's worth a watch, but it's not as amazing as the hype would have you believe.

Some people are avoiding ""Get Out"" because it's a ""horror"" movie, but it's worth seeing just because horror movies don't generally rate oscar nominations. What could have been a movie based racist stereotypes turns into so much more than that yet still still delivers uncomfortable truths. Humor and horror rule the day and Kaluuya is fantastic! Do yourself a favor and see this one.

1306,"10/10 | Audiences have been raving about this upcoming movie and it's relevance to current movements. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to have been the big showing people expected. The plot appears to be a poor child of the Skeleton Key and Stepford Wives. Acting and dialogue didn't increase it's production value. A poor showing.

1311,"6/10 | Jordan Peele won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay!

The premise is about an African American man who is going to visit the parents of his white girlfriend. The atmosphere posed by the film is one of constant tension as we get to know the members of the upper class family, we do not know what Chris the main character is going to happen to him, technically the film stands out in the soundtrack, the photography and in the performances of each character since by their actions we know and intuit that something bad happens but we don't know what! The metaphors about racism, the micro-aggressions towards Chris in an environment that is not comfortable but tries his best to fit in. Finally a chilling secret is revealed and he will have to fight for his life in a final great climax! Horror film that portrays symbolism, social inequality, in the XXI century

1318,"8/10 | Daniel Kaluuya was meant for this role. The character of Chris, based in his personality, is very relatable. Lil Rel Howery, who played Rod, was the best part of the movie. Rod is probably the funniest character I've ever seen in a horror movie. What's perfect about his character is how the comedy isn't over done

Jordan Peele Idea for Get Out is very unique. And the Armitage family was perfect for the story. The was alot of symbolism in the movie which shows Peeles talent in film making. Soundtrack fits perfectly throughout the whole film.

The main issue Peele addresses in this 2017 masterpiece, was racism. I feel this was shown in an appropriate way, and also a way I've never seen before

1319,"7/10 | American Society has undergone certain traumas, racial discrimination being one of them. US racial discrimination has a long history in society and along with its articulation in the law, politics, education and the arts. The movie ""Get Out"" engages and represents the common racial innuendoes which can be experienced in US society even nowadays. The ""Get Out"" looks like a science fiction-drama in the cerebral sorting of people. Several similar points, like a mass brainwashing and ethnic bias, make this movie closer to the public masses that were indoctrinated to hatred in, using similar methods (Holocaust movies, 1984, or The Human Centipede or closed society conspiracy movies.)

In the movie ""Get Out"" the closed society of medical professionals develops the racial theory, in which they exercise white supremacy over black people. African Americans are subject to medical experiments, sexual slavery, and domestic duties. The movie underlines the typical stereotype of African Americans (unable or incapable of mental or intellectual enterprises) and shows how racial microaggression can be multi-faceted. For example, when Dean Armitage, the Caucasian head of this closed club, meets with Chris, the African American boyfriend of Dean's daughter, he (father) denies his own racism by avowing that he supported Obama as the First African American President. It is a typical hook for people who try to refute the racist accusations by declaring that voting for Obama gives immunization from racial discrimination allegations.

Another example of emphasizing the racial stereotypes in the movie is how the guests of ""the symposium"" (in fact - auction) looked at Chris. They looked at him as an object, like goods for sale, not as a person. Guests paid attention only to Chris's physical appearance, not to his personality, his talents as a photographer and etc.

In the ending of movie, the brain of African Americans are just simply removed and trashed in a bin. Metaphorically, the scene of throwing Georgina's scalp in the thrash can symbolizes Dean Armitage's racism theory. They are interested only in the bodies, not in the brain (soul). The racist neuroscientists pay attention to the physical body, not mental capabilities of the brain of African Americans. Moreover, the final scenes reveal that ""crazy brain scholars"" believe the use of the body of an African American can increase their own lifespan.

Thus, the movie allows viewers to extract a number of racial innuendoes. However, all of them can be qualified as verbal and non-verbal. Verbal elements of the movie constitute the bias of white characters against the black people which can be detected directly as racism of the main characters. Non-verbal scenes open the metaphorical level of the expression of racial attitudes of people who exercise their racial prejudice and bias. The movie does not give solutions, but it switches the American problems into the horror genre and focuses viewers to rethink the problem in the thriller framework."

1322,"10/10 | Full of odd shocks and surprises, and definitely worth watching for the psychology dynamics between blacks and whites, historically. It was a simple take, and for comedic purposes, maybe it had to be. We all know white folks are not monolithically like this, and they just ran with the tropes. On one hand, it's irritating, but on the other hand, who am I to say it should have been portrayed differently.

Still, it was a refreshing horror that works on multiple levels. That in itself is a feat. Not just worth watching, but worth owning.

1324,"8/10 | The 1st act was insanely good. A pristine presentation of characters and context with subtle and not that subtle social commentary that couldn't possibly feel more true.

Then, in the second act, the horror starts to take shape but never really gets into form. Anyways, the set-up for a great finale is there.

And then the third act is quite a jump from the rest of the movie. The resolution felt totally fake, out of that world and not true to the characters and context presented in the movie before.

The themes are there, the ideas are there, the talent is there, but the plot asks too much suspension of disbelief and I don't like over the top endings for ""smart movies"". It's wanting to have the cake and eat it too.

1325,"8/10 | This reminded me of League Of Gentlemen, which was a British black comedy series (black as in very dark humour), about an outsider visiting a village full of very strange 'locals'. Tonally this didn't come across as horror as much as it did a black comedy.

It's a decent premise and that feeling of being the outsider in a group of people pretending to accept you is played well.

Where the comedy comes in is in the behaviour of the other 'ethnic minorities' as they respond to Chris (It's more demented than scary as is Caleb Landry Jones Brad Pitt impersonation), as well as the whole idea behind the story - kind of like a sinister Being John Malkovich (also starring Catherine Keener), which makes sense as upon further reading I have discovered this is the unofficial sequel to BJM.

Still, the film has its moments and you find yourself really rooting for Chris willing him to get the hell out of there.

The film missed a trick by confronting the horrors of racism in an everyday way instead opting for almost cinema of the absurd with more than a few surreal Danny Boylian moments.

Violence as the black man's only method of resolution also seems dubious. Other than that it was an enjoyable popcorn movie. Not sure it was worthy of an Oscar. It wasn't that good."
1326,"9/10 | Good but not great. The film blurs the lines between horror and thriller. It takes some unexpected turns but the ending ultimately failed to impress me with its racial-political commentary

1330,"9/10 | Get Out is a good movie. The first time I watched it I didn't like it. The second time I thought it was an amazingly good film. But, like most horror movies, a third time doesn't seem in the books for me.

The actors portray the characters really well. It gets weird when we meet the servants, as they're portrayals are just weird and possibly overacted. The main actresses brother is my favorite part of this film. That actor has some potential, and I would definitely like seeing him in more movies.

1335,"10/10 | This is a good movie. Jordan Peele wrote a fantastic script, and I do like what he has done and the premises. Well deserved with the awards he has won.

The directing of the movie - nothing special. the directing is what you would expect for a general quality theatrical release and I don't feel any special acting was pulled from anyone other than Daniel Kaluuya and the scenes with Lakeith Stanfield. Everyone else, again, just what I would expect.

What I DO NOT understand, how and why this film was marketed as a horror flick. When you do that, expectations are set to actually have some scares and such. A psychological thriller, perhaps. Definitely a thriller and great crime flick. I believe if you market it correctly, then expectations are different and then the problems I have with the film disappear because I don't look for things that aren't there. This was the same issue with M. Night Shyamalan's The Village. When you re-watch and don't have horror movie expectations, it becomes a better flick. I hope the same holds for this as it was well written and could hold up."

1337,"4/10 | First of all, i think its reasonable to mention that im white, and i didn't really think it was scary at all (and im terrible with horror usually). however, it sure as hell isnt the comedy some people make it out to be either. this is also one of those things that are each to their own though, so others may find it way more terriying than i did, which i understand.

with that out of the way, i really liked the script, and i thought the concept was incredibly interesting. its one of the most original horror films ive seen in a long while, and the acting was incredible. the editing was great too, although i remember it defintly followed a specific (over exaggerated? but only in a good way) style of acting, which i applaud them for honestly. the reason i didnt really think much of this movie, honestly just comes down to preference.

conclusion: not everyones cup of tea, not really mine either, but i'd still reccomend it, either way its definitely entertaining."
1338,"2/10 | A black man named Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) has a white girlfriend (Allison Williams). One weekend they go to visit her family for the first time. Her parents live in a huge mansion in the middle of nowhere. Her family welcomes him warmly but then he starts noticing strange things happening and realizes he may be in danger.

It's a good thriller. The acting is good, the twist unexpected and there's some STRONG bloody violence at the end. However it moves slowly and there were a few plot loopholes that I could not ignore. So it's good but has been wildly overpraised. Recommended but don't watch it expecting a masterpiece.

1343,"2/10 | This film called 'Get Out' did not let us be civil because the plot which we won't let out is unexpected. The Scientist like study performed to 'Get Out' puts us uncomfortably at the edge of our seats. The expression 'Spoilt pride' suits this piece. Spoils of this movie are a turn over; being individual rather than objective. The objective truth is the systematic approach to putting us through dangerous attacks of thrilling adventure which goes against visual experience. The experience individually is poor. The experience collectively unattractive but the clues don't add because the plot cannot be revealed. The experiment cannot but work though over seas it can be bothering; so goes a hour and another with a mistake costlier than time. Movies which are watched in the second dimension: provoke us to act like at another cinema but work well when seating still. A Warning to critics to not harm this work.

1356,"5/10 | Get Out is a horror movie directed by Jordan Peele and stars Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Bradley Whitford, Catherine Keener and Caleb Landry Jones.

After reading so much positive reviews about the movie i was really excited about the movie but was also wondering if the movie lives on the expectations and the movie didn't proved me wrong.

The acting is great and screenplay is gripping, although the movie start getting predictable as it progress but still will not disappoint you. The best part of the movie is that the director hasn't done anything to create horror such as no use of eerie music, no jump scares, no use of the darkness, in fact the major part of the movie is shot in ample light.

Background music is been used nicely to create the terrifying atmosphere. I really liked the movie and was impressed and yes, the Climax!!!! this will really shock you. An Entertaining movie."
1357,"5/10 | Perfectly watchable little tale on the Horror-thriller spectrum.

Could have easily been a fair bit better than it is with a script that is somehow very subtle in some areas and painfully on the nose in others. Missed some potentially excellent fridge horror moments.

But I like the story, it's fresh, well paced and has well developed characters. The racial aspect seems more cosmetic than substantial to me, not that that really takes away much.

I feel the script deserved a more experienced director. It's not badly directed but there are several scenes and instances that just feel naively realized, especially regarding the generic score that gives the audience a heads up about what they're supposed to be wary of which kills a lot of the horror potential.

But despite the many wrong notes, the film is essentially made of superior stuff and if only we could maybe get a differently edited version ,this could be a masterpiece."

1360,"2/10 | I avoided this brilliant movie for some time simply because people kept referring to it as a horror film, and when I think horror films I think gouged out eyes and chopped off limbs and intestines on the floor. So the first thing I want to say is, this is really more of a suspense movie and there's very little gore.

Once I finally watched it I was blown away. This is one of those times when a movie really is as good as people say. The movie does a beautiful job of oh-so-slowly ramping up the strangeness, letting each event build on the other in order to build something wonderfully convincing. The suspense always builds slowly, but by the end the movie is soooooo intense that, half an hour after watching it, I still feel jittery as hell.

The filmmaking is sparse and economical, telling a lot with every little movement, every shot, every comment. Daniel Kaluuya is pitch perfect in the lead, offering the sort of deep, nuanced performance more common in searing dramas than thrillers.

The story is fascinating and beautifully constructed, with surprises that never come out of left field.

This is also a very political movie. It brought to mind a movie from my youth, The Stepford Wives, which also used suspense to highlight society's dark side. The early parts of the movie are almost a treatise on micro-aggressions, explaining them to white folk like me better than any of the million articles you can read on the subject.

An amazing film from a first-time director. I can't wait to see what Jordan Peele comes up with next."

The racial part of the film, all white people are bad, seems to be a popularattitude nowadays, and condoning if not perpetrating that false narrative with this film is disgusting to me. I rated this movie as if no political motive was present and its average, worth seeing once.

1378,"7/10 | I really wanted to like this movie much more, but it was just too stereotypical but in a reverse color order.

It had some funny moments, and although very predictable, the attempts at adding in some humor were done very poorly.

The only redeeming quality in this film was how well it was directed, and done so in his first directorial debut by Jordan Peele.

It's a 7/10 from me

The plot, well if you seen any of the Invasion of the Body Snatchers movies and there are many of them, that's the plot of this movie.

1391,"6/10 | The beginning and first 50 minutes are good. You see interesting strings of interracial conflict playing. You watch it and think: what is gonna be next? Okay, problems are gonna emerge, but which ones? And then it comes. But instead of problems you see damn facepalm. The creepy author burns all the good build intrigue to a quite mediocre xenophobic horror. It was a shame to see that. Please do not see, save your time for something better.

If we all want to come together in this world, stop making these foul language, stereotypical movies that are a waste of money when you could make something of quality. The characters are good and creepy, but I just didn't get the movie as a whole.

However the awful story is original. I just can't understand the high scores i really can't,hey i will give any low budget film a chance especially looking at the glowing reviews but this simply isn't the case. This is a bad movie and should be compared to the likes of a badly acted soap opera. Fair play to caleb landry (his part was a stand out acting piece) but as for the rest of them well .......i'm thinking taco bell advertisements at best. Just such a disappointing movie and i must add...an IMDb disappointment,because i followed the scores when i should have spotted this tripe a mile off with the cast alone. Pure and simple this isn't worth watching.

1397,"6/10 | UPDATE: I was not aware this movie had a black agenda before watching it. Now, that I am realising that this is just another ""pitch black people against white people"" movie, I am rating it down from 3 to 1. Bon appetite!

This flick has a few good moments, but is drags on and on and on. I'm all in for story development, but this is just painfully boring. You'll sit through 100 half-napping minutes in order to get to the final conclusion.

Do yourself a favour, and watch ""The Invitation (2015)"" instead.

1406,"3/10 | ""Get Out"" certainly appears promising. A critically acclaimed Oscar-winner, this 2017 horror-comedy was billed as being ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" as directed by Ira Levin (with a large helping of ""Meet the Parents"" to be seen in the film's comedy)- an intriguing combination. It follows Chris Washington, a young black photographer who comes with his white girlfriend Rose to meet her parents. Initially anxious (he asks nervously whether they know he's black, to which she responds that they're very liberal: ""They would have voted for Obama a third time if they could""), he arrives and immediately notices certain irregularities: the cringe-inducing overfriendliness of the parents; the robotic, disconcertingly broad smiles of the black housekeeper and groundskeeper; and, most ominously of all, the fact that one of the people working for the parents, ""Logan"", bears an uncanny resemblance to a missing man, Andre Hayworth.

Up to this point, ""Get Out"" is fairly successful: the plot is immersing, the acting from Kaluuya is spot-on as ever (he behaves exactly as one would expect someone in his situation to- something which adds to the believability immensely), and it's also fairly enjoyable.

However, without giving anything away, the film starts to collapse the more it progresses. Firstly, the tension disappears as soon as the facts start to be revealed. This is because, as H. P. Lovecraft said, ""the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown"". As a horror, ""Get Out"" would be much better if ambiguity about the family's intentions remained in place up to the film's end- that way, the film would have been able to become more frightening as it progressed, not less (this is especially relevant as, even at the start, the film isn't particularly scary.)

Secondly, none of the characters are at all well-developed. If you're going to try to make a social commentary about racial relations in supposedly ""post-racial"" America, it is essential that developed and complex characters exist that can say something about the zeitgeist. Kaluuya, as I've said, does do a good job, but the script is so poor in this regard that not even he can make Chris interesting. Perhaps Jordan Peele, the director, hoped to make him into an everyman figure, but this just demonstrates a poor understanding of what an everyman is- it's not a person with no character, but a person with a character everyone can relate to. All the other characters similarly seem remarkably one-dimensional- Rose has no character at all other than being emotionally detached and cruel. Sure, the way Allison Williams, the actress who plays her, manipulates the audience into trusting her at the start is clever enough, but she goes from being a character who is, if a little boring, at least believable, to a caricature of evil that is undeveloped and one-sided.

Thirdly, the twists aren't nearly as unexpected and unpredictable as Peele seems to think. I don't want to give any spoilers, but anyone who's even vaguely acquainted with the book (or film adaptation of) ""The Stepford Wives"" will be able to guess the main twist from a mile off. The hints should have been much more subtle for the desired effect to be achieved.

Fourth, there are the blatant plot holes, which are drawn into this film like moths to a flame. To take one- let's just say that Chris would have to have extraordinary flexibility to manage his escape.

Finally, the film makes some (unoriginal) points on race relations that will be evident to any viewer in the first five minutes, and then it proceeds to hammer these home for the next one-and-a-half hours. It spends its time repeatedly emphasizing that the characters are white liberals, not neo-Nazi skinheads or southern rednecks- if this point was just made once powerfully, the film could work- instead, it repeatedly makes it with dull jokes, as if Peele intends for the quantity of his complaints to make up for their forgettable delivery. Slavery, lack of attention paid to missing black Americans and the myth of black people having advantages that white people don't are all extremely important subjects, but Peele rants about them so much in the film that his comments eventually lose all power.

Lots of people say that this film is racist. I don't think this is a valid criticism- the lack of good white characters is not saying that white people are bad, whilst black people are good. It's saying that structures in America are such that

Don't bother with it. Try Charles Burnett or Steve McQueen films instead- two directors vastly more talented than Peele will ever be."
1407,"10/10 | Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) is an African-American man who visits his white girlfriend's (Allison Williams) parents for a weekend gateway upstate, as soon as he arrives, he starts to notice some weird things happening that he never expected.

Get Out is for sure one of the best physiological horror films ever, powerful story, powerful message, amazing directing, and brilliantly written.

Daniel Kaluuya's (plays Chris Washington) performance was so shocking, ""The Sunken Place"" scene was one of my favorite scenes of all time, a scene that will get stuck in your head all because of the amazing performance of Daniel Kaluuya, his eyes and the way he was crying makes you feel that you are him for a bit and you are indeed stuck with him in ""the sunken place"" and you can't move from your seat. All of the supporting cast was a great choice especially Allison Williams, also Lil Rel Howery's funny character (Rod Williams) who gave the film a great taste and some funny jokes that weren't silly or boring like these cheap horror movies.

The screenplay was so great and very well written, it's like everything was written for a reason and you'll notice it later, great job to Jordan Peele and so glad that he got an Oscar for that.

The set design was great, Chris' apartment at the beginning of the film and the house of The Armitage family, everything was great. That blue teacup was a thing that I will never forget and anytime I'll see a blue teacup I will remember Get out immediately, it just gets stuck in your head, really loved its design.

The custom designs was a thing that I felt like it was missing, I'm not talking about Chris' blue shirt custom cause it was great but it could've been way better.

Cinematography & colors were also a thing that I felt like it was missing from the movie, especially that the film's story would really match with some colors and it would've given the movie or a certain scene a better taste, but it was's that bad.

Finally, the great music score that did match with the whole film and with every scene perfectly, the music of the opening title scene was great, and the song that was playing when Chris was packing for the weekend at the beginning of the film, was a great choice because if you listen to the lyrics, it matches with the whole story of the film, it says: ""stay woke"" and ""don't close your eyes"", also the music that was playing in ""the sunken place"" scene was so cool especially with how he was falling.

A great physiological horror film but not the best one tho because in my opinion ""Black Swan"" (2010) is the best physiological horror film ever but Get out is still one of the best and highly recommend it.

My rating is: 8.5/10"

1409,"9/10 | Damn, Jordan Peele you son of a .... you did it. A lot of friends suggested this move and i'm glad i watched it, such good actors, storyline and basically the whole picture is great. At first i was kind of getting vibes from the movie 'You're Next' but that quickly took a turn, I loved how the main characters were black really really like that. Daniel Kaluuya did an amazing job at kinda bringing me the same emotions as he had during his experience, also a quick so to the housekeepers maid persons who were great actors (Marcus Henderson and Betty Gabriel) Allison Williams did an okay job, sometimes she was kinda cliche but idk maybe that's just me. Lakeith Stanfield also did an amazing job for how little lines he had. The ending was also so good, this is basically a thriller, sci-fi, comedy and drama movie all in one which i love because sometimes idk what type of movie i want to watch and this one is just al the goods in one. Keep up the great work Jordan Peele, like you always do.

Perhaps the film tries very hard to shove down the message down our throats and maybe that's why I didn't enjoy the thrill much. And the climax for me was a bit dull. ""Black guy triumphs the White guy"" narrative seems too one dimensional for me. It's what I will want in real life but don't exactly expect in a thriller to be honest.

This is one of the lessons we shoud always remember. You can give your trust to them but don't ever be deceived. Always think about the worst case scenarios.

Films like this make the younger generation question a lot of things, unnecessarily. I initially did not want to watch this because of the racial theme, but decided to watch it due to the media hype. OK, so I've seen it, and it was actually better than expected, but I won't watch it again. Racism films should not be made anymore.

The film received over 200 nominations and won 64. Seriously? It was good, but was it really that good??? '

1434,"6/10 | This movie manages to perfectly ride the line between having some great aspects and some really horrible ones at the same time. The acting, cinematography and music are immaculate throughout the movie but it can't resuscitate the plot and confusing theme.

The tropes and cliches of the characters are so over the top during the first 1/2 that a theme of satire feels like its being presented but by the end under a barrage of underlying and overt social commentary it tries to demand you take them seriously in what feels like a campy, predictable twist of events. Definitely not horror, definitely not comical; Much more of a middle of the road thriller that is becomes easily forgettable with a glacially slow middle section, non-sensensical beginning and a walk-off-into-the-night ending. Much of the dialogue was forgettable and almost felt comically forced at times. The climax scenes considered horror weren't anything special at all. The only really great parts are the ones that obviously are a take on a Black Mirror episode.

Ultimately this movie comes across to me as a shell of an idea that they scripted and filled in voids with vapid social commentary and forced cliches. I still think there could have been 1,000 different ways they could have made this into a great movie and I really wanted it to live up to the hype. The heart of a great idea is there its just the execution and confusing plot, beginning, ending and tone that squanders it.

What I keep noticing in movies coming out recently is a penchant for hitting you over the head with information and forcing how you should feel rather than building character, theme and plot. Its really ineffective and lazy. I guess I just prefer more subtle psychological horror like The Shining or something like American History X where it doesn't forcibly spell out everything like we so much of in this Twitter generation."
1435,"6/10 | Like the stepford wives, but reframed with a new subjugated group. If you want masterful suspense, go and watch Hitchcock or read Ira Levin; do not watch this black paranoia flick with boring twist. The characters are bland all the whities are portrayed as inexplicably evil. The action is dull and crude. In essence, it's been done before but much better.

1437,"8/10 | An offbeat horror film and satirical social commentary about race in America where the upper middle class liberals are the creepy villains and their political correctness is actually an overcompensation to mask the disturbing prejudices that lurk beneath. The film takes a detour from the conventional formula of the paranoid community-conspiracy thriller, but it's ultimately just an update on 'The Stepford Wives' with a racial twist.

This is an assured debut from comedian Jordan Peele, helped by an acutely OTT Hitchcockian score and some winning performances, with particular noteworthy turns from Bradley Whitford, who is perfectly cast as the overeager and sinister father, and Daniel Kaluuya, who balances that 'meet the parents' awkward politeness with a jagged edge of paranoia. There are many squirm in your seat moments - some of which are just the scenes where the thinly-veiled animosity and racial subtext bubble beneath the surface of the dialogue - and the unsettling atmosphere of the piece keeps you digesting in the dark underbelly of rich white suburbia right alongside Kaluuya's protagonist.

Peele manages to keep the story taut for the first hour, with heightened moments of almost comical tension, leaving the viewer unsure as to when things will spill over into pure horror, which it inevitably does. And once all the cards are put on the table much of the tension deflates and the situations become more arch and silly, from the weak comic relief sidekick subplot to the unnecessary expository villainy. All subtly and nuance is suddenly jettisoned at the tap of a teaspoon and Peele lowers the bar by over-explaining everything to his audience, perhaps the only real sign of his inexperience as a cinematic storyteller.

The other major problem with the film is that it's too predictable in terms of its plot to fulfill the thriller criteria of shock and surprise. There is never much doubt as to what is really happening and that takes away from the experience somewhat, but 'Get Out' is still a nerve-jangling tale for about an hour and change even though the third act is pure hokum. The best way to look at this is as a very twisted 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' for millennials."
1438,10/10 | 
1439,"3/10 | As an horror/thriller movie it works pretty well. It is very well shot, very well acted but the whole story is made obvious way too soon to keep us scared by the whole setup. Said differently what is really going on is way too technical, mundane in itself to keep the movie at the same level of anguish, horror, fantasy...

I discussed it with a friend and he gave me a very good explanation of the subtext, ie. the social commentary. Most reviewers mistook the premise for a take on Racism 3.0 while it is definitely about the appropriation of Black Culture.

Nobody is racist in this movie, they just overtly envy Blacks. This is just the opposite sin, the materialist stance that views other people as a way to enrich your life without giving something back. This is not ugly racism, this is only class egoism. This would be the same with the same affluent WASPs having a paternalistic behaviour with poor whites (there are movies about this: Rich bored guy goes out to have fun with simple peasants then goes back to his comfortable condo with a year-worth of shrink realization). Only here WASPs have a very specific history of poaching on new frontiers and appropriating Black Culture.

So yes, despite its strengths and original premise Get Out covers too much territory from horror to thriller, fantasy and social commentary. My guess is the social commentary is lost for most... except black people but it made for an eerie backdrop which all the same mesmerized most of the viewers."

1441,"10/10 | 'My parents are not racist', Rose tells her boyfriend Chris when she's planning to introduce him to her mum and dad. She's not planning to tell them Chris is black. Why should she? They're not racist.

Indeed, her parents seem to be more worried about his smoking habit than about his skin colour. But the fact remains that they employ two black servants, who seem rather submissive and not very talkative.

The first part of this film is a clever exploration of race relations. Chris feels that something strange is going on in the household of his girlfriend's parents, but he doesn't know what.

Only in the second half it becomes clear what is going on. The movie changes radically: thriller and horror elements take over. Subtlety makes way for straightforward violence, the viewer is treated to a series of bloody killings, contrasting strongly with the sophisticated observations about race relations.

This is a film with two faces: intelligent drama and bloody horror. You could argue that it's clever to combine both elements, but it's also the weak point. Viewers who don't like horror (like me) are disappointed by the bloody second half, viewers who do, will find the first part boring."

1444,"10/10 | I don't see too many of these type of teen horror movies as they are rarely good or original.

There have been a few original ideas that made good small films - ""it follows"" was a shining example. But Get Out comes at things quite differently - being both political, occasionally funny and appropriately weird.

In the end you are presented with a cross between Being John Malkovich and The Lobster, with not quite enough developed material to pull it through. The performances give it a little gravitas, but the ambition tails off.

1445,"5/10 | I watched ' Get Out ' last night after waiting so long to see it, but I have to say that it was so boring that I kept nodding off. Billed as a horror mystery with a hint of black comedy, there was nothing scary about the movie, I knew what was going to happen about 20 minutes into the movie, & I didn't find anything remotely amusing in the movie. What I will say about the movie is that it is very racist against white people & it tries to make out that all white's are closet racists, which is basically the crutch of the movies story-line. I did however, know something about the movies story-line before viewing it, so was expecting this, but I didn't find out until after I had viewed the movie that it was directed by a black guy, which shines a whole different light on the movie in my opinion, as it makes it a racist commentary rather then interesting social commentary.

The story line was super predictable and even included final shots where the white ""honey trap"" opening her eyes when apparently left dead on the road. Hardly original. it was a bad movie with an overt anti-white theme. if it had been made the other way (i.e. white guys being kidnapped and made into zombies by black guys) it would have been laughed at and called racist but here i have seen commentaries saying the acting was academy award quality. in summary, if you want to see a bad movie about bad white people and good afroamericans then this is for you.

1447,"6/10 | My brother and I recently watched Get Out, and we absolutely loved it. I would highly recommend for horror movie fans.

It may require a second viewing to pick up the crazy smart foreshadowing that's present within the film. The whole concept of it was pretty terrifying, and that's always a great thing for a horror movie.

I won't say anything else because you should go ahead and watch Get Out, but be wary of the last 20 minutes.

Last thing: Kudos to Jordan Peele for making such an awesome departure from sketch comedy to horror.

I watched it for the second time last night and it was nearly as good as the first. The denouement (sp) was just as exciting, and I noticed all the little details this time around. This and Us (2019) really cemented Peele as a stand out horror/thriller director.

1449,"10/10 | This film is quite effective as a horror movie. I usually don't like the genre but I did enjoy this one. Everything is revealed slowly with good pacing and little hints here and there to add to the mystery. The characters, twists and scares never feel ""cheap"" as they do in more sensationalistic works. The plot is not entirely original - I swear I've seen this in some old show like Goosebumps or Eerie, Indiana a long time ago - but the way it's integrated into racial issues made it interesting.

1450,"7/10 | We have seen so many films about racism that we are trained to feel some tension even when we just see a couple of a black man and a white woman in a film. ""Get Out"" very cleverly takes advantage of this tension to make it a suspenseful thriller film.

The couple visits Armitage's house. Again we are trained to suspect there is something behind when we see a white family whose members are friendly to their daughter's black boyfriend. This suspicion is further encouraged by the excellent cinematography and music, makes it a very compelling mystery.

Pretentiously praising black people is sometimes as disgusting as outright racism, and that's what we see in the party scene. A guest even says ""Black is in fashion."" It is fascinating to see the rich and sophisticated old white people hiding some desire behind their friendly smile.

Although what's happening in the film is horrific and cruel, I like how it remains somewhat comedic. I think that is partly because of Daniel Kaluuya's acting, which is emotionally restrained and goes along with the film's cynical and humorous tone. Chris is a protagonist who observes things rather than a protagonist who reacts to things. Also, I like Rod as a clear comic relief, who keeps the film from becoming too serious."
1451,"3/10 | Get Out has a fascinating concept that lends itself to both good scares and powerful commentary. It's thought-provoking, well-acted, and artistic, and leaves me excited to see what Peele has in score for us next.

1452,"5/10 | Welcome to a world where you really can judge people by the color of their skin. In case you forget which race is superior, a character will be sure to inform you, and the odd thing? they all agree. Moving past this, the film has other issues.

I missed the ""hype"" just saw this on a recommendation. It's a well written adaptation of a less well known film Skeleton Key (2005) Unlike the original, Get Out completely fails to be scary. Part of it is it fails to place us on the protagonist side. Washington is plenty sympathetic, but he lacks that feeling of powerlessness that would make it horror.

Second, it fails to even make it to Noir, when the film's director is clearly on the protagonists side. Instead of Murphy's Law ruling the twists, things tend to happen which are conventient for Washington to notice everything going on and be able to do something about it.

I don't really have a third, there are just little writing things that bugged me all the way through, subtle details, traits of his character, profession etc fail to come into the fold as dominant story arc drivers and are more window dressing.

That said, the film has some genuinely creepy moments, and outside of some extraneous out-of-setting scenes with characters who have no narrative impact, it's mostly believable. There's some definite Guess Who's Coming to Stepfordness to it all, but there's not enough here to forgive it for fanning the flames of racism. It's an entertaining watch if you have nothing else to see and don't mind being ranted at about the Peele's feelings of racial superiority."

1455,"10/10 | I quite enjoyed this film, with a racial slant, which was probably unnecessary, however the director is tapping in to the sad divisions in the west at the moment, which no doubt has boosted views and ratings.

The film is quite weird throughout, but enjoyable. It has been popping up in top rated horrors, when i am looking for a film to watch, which essentially drew me to the film. It in no way should be brought within a best horror film list, however as i said, the director played to the outrage crowd that will give it high ratings as they pander to the racial divisions of society.

The story throughout is intiguing and keeps you watching to the end. If you are not keen on classic films like videodrome, IT, white worms lair you will not enjoy this. I have done the hard work for you here and do not watch, as parts of the film annoy you(not as much as thise films though).

If you are a movie fan, you will want to see this, as many will have enjoyed it and I have to say, i did eventually, it was a bit of a struggle at early points. I have to say, the young fella Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the role and his friend Lil Rel Howery adds for some decent laughs regarding racial stereotypes.

I gave the film 7, therefore, give it a watch, but do not make it a priotity watch."
1456,"7/10 | This movie was pretty predictable. Unique yes. Entertaining? Not really. I found myself dozing a few times in the theatre. For me this wasn't the masterpiece it claimed to be. I wouldn't watch it again but for a one time watch it was fine. But easy to forget right when you leave the theatre.

1459,"10/10 | In the film ""Get Out"" by the director Jordan Peele, he uses different methods throughout the film that bring up the painful history of the racism in America. The actual suspenseful effect that the film had was very powerful, some parts of the movie made me feel like the actions that some of the characters were partaking in were happening to me. This film is horror/suspense based and it is centered by a interracial couple, the African American male Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), and the female, Rose (Allison Williams). The couple had been dating for over some months now and it was time for Chris to meet Rose's parents. Get out takes you through a various ride of emotions almost feeling like I was connecting to some of the characters at times. Chris had previous worries about his race towards her parents, once they arrived to her parents house and are a bit more settled in, Chris begins to feel more paranoid on what they are hiding from him. As the film goes on in kind of turns into more of a horror film having all of the audience on the edge of their seats. Jordan Peele uses such a unique way of truly attracting the audience to the film, considering the music as well. The Swahili song that gets recognized throughout the whole film by being in the background keeps an ongoing eerie feeling that something bad is yet to come. Peele does an absolutely outstanding job showing the similarities between all the black characters in the movie at Rose's parents house. In the film the acting is incredible, it almost made me forget who the the actors were because they were playing the part of their characters so well. One of my favorite parts in the movie shows how I was able to connect to some of the racial stereotypes Chris was facing during a family party at Rose's parents house. At some times Jordan Peele throws in some of his comedic sense of humor at some of the almost screeching horrific parts of the film. Get Out brings up the sad and hurtful passed of racism but also it connects to the way Chris feels when he is in the sunken place. Because he felt like he had no control over what was going on, same with the racism in the past and how many African Americans were being controlled. This film also connects back to an older suspenseful like horror film called The Shining. Jordan Peele was very inspired by this movie because it gave Get Out more twisted clues at times that no one would notice until the second time they watch it. From the beginning to the end of the movie Peele has everyone on their toes horrified on what's to come. A reference to another director/author that could've been used to make this film would've been Stephen King, just because he makes horror films that include some comedic features that seep through during some of the more suspenseful parts of the film. Some ways Jordan Peele could've made this movie more prestigious is if he hadn't had the funny black TSA character Rod who is Chris's friend, stop out of the police car to save Chris but instead have actual police officers step out while he is in the middle of trying to save himself from Rose. This change would've made the whole audience stand up in anger and start to yell at the characters to try and help them. This will forever be one of my recent favorite horror films, it gave me all the emotions one could have within an hour and forty five minutes. Until Jordan Peele comes out with another movie that matches this one it will be on the top of the scale in my mind and in the category of suspenseful films as well. I am pretty positive the whole audience was pleased after watching this incredible film, it was definitely worth the wait and seeing it in the theater! Get Out is highly recommended to watch and then watch it again and notice the little things that show some of the hidden secrets that show what they are hiding at the end."

1465,"3/10 | But it just wasn't my cup of tea. I think a lot of white liberals and progressives are lying about what they thought of the film; I say this as a white Lefty who felt compelled to lie about what I thought when I first saw the film. Here's my honest opinion:

I think the only reason the film got so much attention was because of white guilt and atonement for the Oscars' neglect of black filmmakers and artists. It's really easy for white people to go to the film and sing its praises in order to show how ""woke"" they are. But that's incredibly dishonest. The film is cynical and stigmatizes interracial relationships. It's super manipulative. The black characters are painted as helpless victims while the white people are all painted as evil villains. This idea that people of color in interracial relationships are being entrapped by white people into interracial relationships is intellectually lazy.

I did appreciate the satirizing of northern WASPs who ""would have voted for Obama a third time if they could have."" When I tell people I'm from the South, I get enough looks of pity and/or ""you don't have an accent"" comments to understand how insufferable these types of people can be. Jordan Peele clearly seems to have a lot of experience with these sort of elite circles (he grew up on the Upper West Side and went to Sarah Lawrence), so I can't really knock him for writing a film about what he knows.

But films should be evaluated on the strength of their writing and the acting, not because they are serving to assuage people's white guilt or as an antidote to Hollywood's overwhelming whiteness. There have been *PLENTY* of great black films, directors, actors, and actresses that are light years better than what we are presented with in ""Get Out."""
1466,"5/10 | Great direction, great performances, but come on the story is horrible, even for a mystery movie it´s crap!! This movie only represents the current psychosis the african american people still have about the red necks!! The Oscar nomination is only to cover the inclusion due they have year by year. That´s, it for me the Academy has lost all their reputation nominating this crap. I´ll never follow Academy nominations to look for good movies. The same was last year with La La Land & Moonlight.

1468,"6/10 | It was enjoyable. It is a horror and a comedy too. Most importantly it was bizarre! I mean when you imagine yourself in the same situation and you can think see through the whole thing while the main actor can't.. Then it's wrong.

The only reason this movie got Oscar nominations because is because the main actor is black and the director is black. That's all. They don't deserve it by any means. It is a comedy where cops don't give a d**n about a missing person and they laugh at you. Where a cop can't talk seriously.

Also if you walk on the street and someone is looking at you from the other side you can somehow just feel and you will turn there, this happens all the time with every single person on Earth. There are like 30 and the main actor doesn't notice anything beside that the black fellas are acting weirdly. What?

I would rather give Oscar for Paranormal Activity than this in the same genre."
1469,"6/10 | So, it's date number two, we go out for a dog walk and then I take her back to my place. She looks superb and even changes into something a little more 'comfortable' when she arrives. Neither of us like horror films but we tried this film out, turns out the only horror related thing in this film was that it was horrorble. Was it even meant to be scary? Or was it a comedy? I recall 2 moments where my heart sped up but it was clearly down to the fajitas I had made at the interval. Acting was average, purpose was still unknown, the highlight was Bramble (my dog) cuddling in between us - and that costs nothing. If you are thinking of watching this movie, you're better off going down to b&q and buying a £5 pot of paint, painting a wall and then watching it dry. That will be a more entertaining evening than watching this atrocious film, and you'd save money. My date actually left and drove 70 miles North-East to get as far away from this film as possible. So would I recommend this movie to a friend? Yes, but only if I had just found out that that friend had hooked up with my woman, but even then I would feel that punishment it too severe. If I don't get a third date I will be suing the makers of the movie for damages, although the memories will never fade.

1471,"9/10 | Just saw this after cnn or bbc mentioned it as one of the winners of 2017. The story is nothing new: the main character visits some place where the people are not what they seem, turns out these people take ""good"" care of their visitors. It reminds me a bit of the body-snatchers, the stepford wives and some other 70's movies with the same theme. The result: its not scary, the story is predictable, frankly its boring. I guess there is some political message in there, but who cares, its still boring.

Everything can be seen coming a mile away. A lady stirs her tea in front of you and your hypnotized? Really? White people get together to hold secret auctions of black people? A brain surgeon and psychiatrist just happen to be married so they can wreak their havoc on black people? I didn't get creeped out or scared the entire movie. Kind of boring actually. Literally no real scares in this movie. I don't know what they were going for here but it just doesn't work. Nothing meshed.

1478,"5/10 | OK, so this is a horror film which is not a genre I normally entertain and I would probably have never seen it if friends had not taken me. But this is a horror film which is as smart as it is scary, featuring a clever plot with some sharp twists, a political satire on liberal views of race, and even some humour. Made on a tiny budget of $4.5M, the movie has been a spectacular success earning over $200M at the box office.

""Get Out"" is the directorial debut of African-American Jordan Peele who also wrote the script and who is an actor and comedian as well as a film-maker. Following an opening sequence which is only explained at the end, we join black Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) and his white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) on a trip to meet her parents whom we are told are Obama-supporting liberals. So what could possibly go wrong? The title hints that plenty could - and it does in a work that could have been called (except the title has already been used) ""There Will Be Blood"".

1479,"10/10 | It's fairly rare these days that a horror movie get's the kind of critical praise that it receives and ""Get Out"", which marks the directorial debut of Jordan Peele has managed to somehow pull off just that. This having been said, Peele has called his movie a social thriller but let's face facts, it's a Horror movie and a rather mediocre one at that. Starring Daniel Kaluuya, who incidentally I previously know from his role as Tealeaf in the cult British Horror/comedy TV series, ""Psychoville"". The film centres around a young black man who goes to meet the affluent parents of his white girlfriend. Upon meeting the potential husband to be finds something unsettling about the unnatural friendliness of the father, and as the day progresses he begins to learn some disturbing truths by which time it might already be too late.

Although a tad rough around the edges which I could forgive that being that this was the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, who also wrote the screenplay. It still however gets off to a strong start, and there's an intriguing set-up with a potent air of mystery and a quiet unease which is palpably felt early on. It also easy to see shades of Ira Levin's ""The Stepford Wives"" and Kevin Smith's ""Red State"" where I think it's fairly safe to say Peele was influenced by. Serving as a satirical allegory (very much in a similar vein of ""The Stepford Wives"") of post racial tensions in the U.S., any sharp observations it attempts to make end up playing second fiddle to it's horror movie elements. And even then when those start to come to the fore the movie lacks any real tension. I simply didn't feel as if I was on the edge of my seat quite like I was supposed to be.

The occasional humorous moments with the lead character's best friend doesn't really gel with the whole tone of the movie, and it really beings to lose it in the final third where it descends in to sloppily handled cliché ridden fodder. Worse yet, the family are so aloof and cold within the context of how the story plays out to the point that it's laughable. Add to this a tacked on denouement which given that there was an alternate, original ending and it's more than apparent that it's being clumsily shoehorned in.

Despite all this there are some some wonderful performances with both Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener being unnervingly clean-cut and buttoned down parents, with Stephen Root also on top form. The stand-out however is Daniel Kaluuya who makes for a likable and charismatic protagonist, who manages to understatedly invoke the sense of paranoia and threat that he feels. Sadly although not terrible he really deserved better to work with in terms with than what feels like something of a wasted opportunity. As social commentaries go it just doesn't hold entirely together well as it should. Although to be fair this is not the worst attempt at melding social commentary with the Horror genre, with director Brian Yuzna's awful 1989 effort, ""Society"" taking the number one spot. This is the ""Citizen Kane"" of Horror movies in comparison."
1480,"5/10 | Get Out is great thriller, I wouldn't call it a horror as it wasn't really scary to me, and I thought the aim was more to tell an interesting story, which it did. The oppressive atmosphere and varied characters really makes this film one to remember.

1494,"3/10 | A measured and endearing enough beginning as a couple proceed to 'meet the parents'. The fact that she is white, the family wealthy and he is black shouldn't make any difference. Should it? He is aprehensive and we understand and to some extent share his concerns, especially as she seems not to have any similar concerns. This is where we are already sensing something is wrong but when things turn 'weird' at the house we rather relax into the notion that this is going to be a horror story, maybe based on the guy's paranoia. Well, this goes way beyond that into 'Society' and 'Stepford Wives' territory, but always with an element of race. This becomes more and more pronounced until the film is about little else and the audience is set up to cheer the death count (of the white folk). Allison Williams is a real discovery and will surely go on to greater things and the director too clearly has skills but that chip on his shoulder and a liking for racial humour may hold him back.

However, this one must have went right over my head because I did not catch any hidden messages or deeper meanings. Maybe I have to watch it a second time... Maybe I have to pay more attention... but it is hard to believe there is not something I am missing when ""Get Out"" has the mood & atmosphere it has! Whatever the reason, I expected more than what was there. It is possible I just had my hopes up too far. Having said that, I still give it a good ""7"". :) ... I did feel like it was leading to something that it never really got to. If they did a continuance, maybe it would redeem the last hour for me. Do not get me wrong, I usually love it when I think it is going in one direction & takes a complete turn & surprises me! This however, did not work out that way.

But it doesn't mean you have to settle for nonsense and label it an achievement. Go back and watch your favorite horror movie again for the 13th time. Don't waste a 1st on the over-hyped.

1509,"5/10 | This movie was just OK. Same story line as The Skeleton Key, but The Skeleton Key was much better!!! I am not sure why this movie is getting so much hype, when it is literally a knock off. I know it is hard to come up with new ideas. I only suggest watching this for the comparison.

1511,"5/10 | It's my first review and i'm not that good in writing in English but i have to write this review. Why? Because this is the first case of watching two films in one (at least for the films i've seen). I'll divide film in two parts because at a certain point we'll basically have a change of genre and a totally different film from first part. My rating for first part of the film is 10. I'm not kidding. First part is awesome. I'll tell later where this part ends and starts delirium. Rating for 2nd part (delirium, maybe author delirium. Don't know but i would like to know who smoked what) is 0. So (10+0)/2 it's 5. Can't go on without spoil so... FROM THIS POINT ON THE REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. First part, as i said, it's awesome. It's thrilling, you don't know what to expect but you'll understand that something isn't good with that family and protagonist will understand with you. You'll feel a bit of panic, you'll fear your gf mother and maybe a bit more your gf father. Oh wait i was talking about the film... The point is: the film will get your attention. Now the spoiler: the film will drastically fall after the protagonist asked for car keys to her gf. I'm not kidding again. 2nd part starts in this moment. I loved how it turned out that gf wasn't that sweet but then... Second part starts. It becomes a sci-fi Frankestein based about a mad scientist with a mad family and mad relatives. I would like to know how protagonist put cotton in his ears too. Wasn't he tied? And why he casually started killing?! Atmosphere was saying ""he is afraid, he wants to escape"", not ""he is afraid, he wants to KILL, KILL, KILL!"". I'm really sad to say that second part of this film is... I won't say that word. I'll just say BAD, REALLY BAD. Film had potential. Wasted."

1515,"2/10 | This was the directorial debut of Jordan Peele, who then went on to create Us (2019) and co produce Hunters. The plot is a back man meeting his white girlfriend's parents to stay there for a while. This is the best example of slowburn done right, a lot of people hate slow films because usually it drags on without anything interesting happening. This does slightly drag on, but doing so manages to brilliantly add more tension each scene. From unsettling house keepers, a creepy brother, gatherings and strange talks with the parents. All of this resulting in a highly intelligent twist that will leave you scratching your head and also allows people to create their own theories on it. Several amazing details hidden in the scenes will have you coming back to watch again, eyeing the screen for clues. Daniel Kaluuya did a fantastic performance, along with the rest of the cast. Especially Caleb Landry Jones, playing a very off and strange character pretty much perfectly. The humor is just right in this film as well, some may say it's a horror comedy, I somewhat agree. But it adds enough laughs to keep it well above entertaining, but doesn't ruin the creepy vibe throughout the film either. I was shocked how this was the guy behind Key and Peele, making it a bigger achievement. Honestly everything about the film was great, but sorry this review was rather short. If you haven't watched this, please do. verdict: Humor, excellent foreshadowing and scares make this a horror film worth watching more than once. Get Out gets a big fat A"
1516,"2/10 | A beautiful and psychological horror film who know a guy who was fantastic at comedy was an Alfred Hitchcock of our modern time as a horror director Jordan Peele has truly made some fantastic thing so far and I truly can't wait to see what he has next in the store for us But don't just take my word for it see this film yourself it's an entertaining piece of art. Don't miss it if you have been under a rock and haven't seen it.

1517,"1/10 | This movie had a really interesting premise, and delivered it perfectly. The pacing was slow, which added to the suspense and mystery of the story. The performances were good, the directing was excellent, and this film had me still thinking about it several days later. I would highly recommend it, as it is a great horror movie with an enticing, original story.

1526,"6/10 | Tells such an interesting story, leaves the audience on the hook the whole time. Be thankful if you had the ""in-theatre experience"" with this one.
